ACTIONS: [Ask a question to disambiguate the input provided, write the response]

I need you to help me translate an OWL ontology in turtle format to a mermaid diagram.
Generate a mermaid diagram using classDiagram format for the owl input that follows, using the following guidelines.

I need you to write:
    1. Ouput Summary: The summary that describes the mermaid diagram. First write a short description of the provided
    OWL ontology. This short description should never exceed 10 sentences. The summary should only store key information.
    Write the reasoning steps followed in order to generate the proposed mermaid diagram.
    Write one sentence for each reasoning step description.

    2. Output Tasks: The generated MERMAID code-block must follow the input instructions and be strict to the output
    using MERMAID CLASS DIAGRAM format.

Here is the input:

    Input OWL ontology in turtle format:
    {input}

Now start writing, organize your output by strictly following the output format as below:
    Output Summary:
        Summary: <string that explains the owl ontology>, around 10 to 20 sentences.
        Rational: <enumeration of the reasoning steps>, one enumerated sentence for each reasoning step.

    Output Tasks: <MERMAID CLASS DIAGRAM syntax following the previous reasoning steps>
    Finish Statement: <write "FINISH" to indicate the end of the output>

Very important:
First analyze the ontology and consider an appropriate action to generate the response.
Do not forget to write Finish Statement: FINISH at the end of your response.
