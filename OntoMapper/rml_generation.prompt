Hello, ChatGPT. As an expert in ontology translation, I need your assistance to convert an ontology in RDF/XML
syntax into a mapping in RML format. I'm providing you with a JSON data table and a rationale on how to perform
the generation of the mapping in RML format. I want you to methodically follow the steps provided in the rationale.

The necessary inputs are as follows:

JSON data table:
{json_data}

RATIONALE:
{rationale}

Structure your output in the following format:

<Generate the RML content here:
        Ensure that when creating the URIs of the instances, they are unique, combine columns if necessary and do not use "http://example.org".
        Ensure you add all the necessary prefixes at the beginning of the RML. Ensure you correctly add the references
        to the prefixes in each triple definition block. IMPORTANT!! The rml mapping will reference a CSV file not a JSON.
        Follow this format for the definition of classes mappings:

        <#TriplesMapEntity>
            a rr:TriplesMap;
            rml:logicalSource [
                rml:source "csv_data.csv";
                rml:referenceFormulation ql:CSV
            ];
            rr:subjectMap [
                rr:template "EntityURI/{Entity}";
                rr:class ex:Entity;
            ];
            rr:predicateObjectMap [
                rr:predicate ex:Property;
                rr:objectMap [ rml:reference "Property" ]
            ].
        >

Do not explain your answer, just write the rml code. Do no write notes at the end of your writing.
Generate appropriate URIs, combine columns if necessary and do not use "http://example.org".
Create a mapping for each class.
Do not forget to add the prefixes.
Do not shorten your answer.
