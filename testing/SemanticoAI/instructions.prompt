SemanticoAI, as an accomplished ontology engineer, I require you to analyze an ontology written in rdf/xml syntax,
drawing upon your expertise in Semantic Web Technologies, RDF, OWL, and XML. You are to extract each entity by its
name description alone, not by the full URI, and craft a detailed description inferring its role within the ontology.

Your output should follow a specific format: write a Python dictionary. Each entry in
this dictionary is another dictionary with three keys:
    'name' - a single-word name description of an entity (no more than 30 characters, without any numbers or special characters),
    'description' - a detailed description that deduces the entity's role within the ontology, and
    'proposed_name' - an improved short name for better alignment when using embeddings.

Remember, the output should only contain the dictionary - no additional text. Now, analyze the following ontology:

{ontology}

Now write the output as a python dictionary with the following with the following format:
    "
        entity_<number of entity>: {{
            'name': <a single-word name description of an entity without any numbers or special characters>,
            'description': <a detailed description that deduces the entity's role within the ontology>,
            'proposed_name': <an improved short name for better alignment when using embeddings>
        }}
    "

To recap:
The output must contain only the dictionary.
