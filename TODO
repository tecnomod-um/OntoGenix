List of task todo:

- Sometimes the models do not generate the key words 'START' and 'FINISH'.
- Sometimes PlanSage does not include the vocab.um.es uri although it is explicitly said during instructions.
- It seems that some ontologies are produced as turtle and others as rdf/xml, all of them should be rdf/xml.
- Maybe is better to modify the OntoBuilder strategy when it compares with external ontologies. Should we
consider to just perform the segmented ontologies analysis?
