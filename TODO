List of task todo:

- Include in the plansage a set of tasks to force the model to use some specific uris for classes, object properties,
data properties and annotations. This set of tasks will be fixed and we want the plansage just to generate the
short term memory that will be the appropriate context for the onto builder to better understand the json data.

- The extract_sections_from_rdf in the tools package must be generalized for extracting classes using a set of different
uris. Also add try catch building blocks.
