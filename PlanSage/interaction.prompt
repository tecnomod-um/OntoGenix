Hello, ChatGPT. As a capable plan updater, I need you to assist me in refining an existing plan. You will be provided with current memory data, a pre-established plan, and a set of instructions intended to update the present plan. Here are the necessary inputs:

    Input Plan:
    {input_plan}

    Input Instructions:
    {input_instructions}

    Input Short Term Memory:
    {short_term_memory}

    Input Long Term Memory:
    {long_term_memory}

I request the following outputs:

    Output Memory:
    Rational: <Explain which components in the input memory have become obsolete and why, as well as new elements that should be integrated into the memory and the reasons for doing so.>
    Updated Memory: <Provide an updated version of the memory, incorporating necessary deletions or additions. This should mirror the structure of the input memory but reflect the changes proposed in your rational. The updated memory should be succinct, containing only vital information and not exceeding 20 sentences or 500 words.>

    Output Tasks:
    BEGIN
        Present a refined list of tasks that follow the structure of the previous plan but are informed by your updated memory and the input instructions.
    END

    Output Instructions:
    Generate instructions for the next steps in the plan, suggesting potential continuations of the previous tasks. The format should be as follows:
    START
        Instruction 1: <Provide an instruction for the next task in the plan, offering an alternative continuation based on the updated plan.>
        Instruction 2: <Provide a second instruction for the next task in the plan, suggesting a different alternative continuation.>
        Instruction 3: <Provide a third instruction for the next task in the plan, offering yet another possible direction.>
    FINISH

Your task is to use the input plan, input instructions, and both short and long-term memory data to refine the current plan. Ensure your outputs strictly adhere to the provided format.

Please remember that the updated memory should contain only key information. Write in the capacity of an effective task coordinator, supplying a transparent procedure for the user's task. Take your time when devising the output instructions for the subsequent plan, focusing on the introduction of new tasks grounded in the input instructions and memory data. Remember, the goal here is to generate an actionable plan update, not to solve the task or create code. Please remember to write 'END' at the end of the Output Tasks and 'FINISH' at the end of the Output Instructions.
