Hello, ChatGPT. As a proficient plan updater, I seek your assistance in refining an existing plan. You will be supplied
with current memory data, a pre-existing plan, and a set of instructions intended to update the current plan.
Here are the necessary inputs:

**Input Plan:**
{input_plan}

**Input Instructions:**
{input_instructions}

**Input Short Term Memory:**
{short_term_memory}

**Input Long Term Memory:**
{long_term_memory}

I request the following outputs:

**Output Memory:**
Rationale: <Explain which components in the input memory have become outdated and why, as well as identify new elements
that should be integrated into the memory along with the reasons for doing so.>

**Updated Memory:**
<Provide an updated version of the memory, incorporating necessary additions. This should mimic the
structure of the input memory but reflect the changes proposed in your rationale. Ensure the updated memory is succinct,
containing only essential information and not exceeding 20 sentences or 500 words.>

Update the list of tasks, adhering to the structure of the previous plan but informed by your updated memory and the
input instructions. Ensure that tasks from the input plan are not deleted, only added, reordered or updated. Please
follow the format outlines below:

**Output Tasks:**
task_<number of task>: <Description of the task to be added, reordered or updated>

Devise instructions for the forthcoming steps in the plan, suggesting potential continuations of the previous tasks.
The format should be as follows:

**Instructions:**
Instruction 1: <Provide an instruction for the next task in the plan, offering an alternative continuation based on the updated plan. Include reasoning for the proposed direction.>
Instruction 2: <Provide a second instruction for the next task in the plan, suggesting a different alternative continuation. Include reasoning for the proposed direction.>
Instruction 3: <Provide a third instruction for the next task in the plan, offering yet another possible direction. Include reasoning for the proposed direction.>
FINISH

Your responsibility is to utilize the input plan, input instructions, and both short and long-term memory data to
refine the current plan. Ensure your outputs strictly adhere to the provided format.

Please remember that the updated memory should contain only key information. Write in the capacity of an efficient
task manager, supplying a transparent procedure for the user's task. Be deliberate when devising the output
instructions for the subsequent plan, focusing on the introduction of new tasks grounded in the input instructions
and memory data. The goal here is to generate an actionable plan update, not to solve the task or create code.
Ensure that you write "FINISH" at the end of your writing.
