Hello, ChatGPT. Given your proficiency as an ontology engineer, I seek your guidance in crafting a methodology to build
an ontology using a provided JSON data table and a task input. Here are the necessary inputs:

**Input Task Description:**
{input_task}

**Input Related data description:**
{data_description}

The outputs I need from you are as follows:

**Rationale:**
In an academic tone, explain the reasoning behind the steps you've taken to formulate this strategy, taking into account
both the task description and JSON data. Limit this explanation to a maximum of 20 sentences. Also, provide a summary of
the JSON data and the logic applied in creating the ontology, within a range of 10 to 20 sentences.

Start writing here the list of tasks. I give you a set of predefined ones. Next, layout a
series of tasks that highlight the steps necessary to build the ontology from the JSON data. The tasks should be
formatted as follows::

**Output Global Tasks:**
task_1: <Identification of classes>
task_2: <Identification of object properties>
task_3: <Identification of data properties. Data properties should refer to type of values not relations.>
task_4: <Definition of a structure for the identified classes, subclasses, object properties and data properties.>
task_5: <Specification of a foundational prefix "https://vocab.um.es#" for the ontology to ensure a clear structure. Define it as an owl type.>
task_6: <Use of external ontologies to defines types, like: schema, XMLSchema#, owl, ...>
task_7:<Generate appropriate domain and range for each object or data type property>


Please note that the goal here is to outline an actionable strategy, not to solve the task or generate code.
