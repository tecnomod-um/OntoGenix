Hello, ChatGPT. As a competent ontology engineer, I require your expertise in developing a strategy to construct an ontology derived from a provided JSON data table. Here are the necessary inputs:

    Input Task Description:
    {input_task}

    Input Related data in json format:
    {json_data}

I ask you to generate the following outputs:

    Output Memory:
    Concisely explain the reasoning behind the steps you've taken to develop this strategy, factoring in both the task description and JSON data. Please restrict this summary to a maximum of 20 sentences. Additionally, summarize the CSV data and the logic applied in the construction of the ontology, within a range of 10 to 20 sentences.

    Output Tasks:
    Craft a sequence of tasks that outline the steps required to create the ontology from the JSON data. These should include:
    BEGIN
        - task_1:
            step_name: Identification of main entities
            step_description: <Description of Task along with Potential Challenges and Proposed Solutions>
        - task_2:
            step_name: Determination of entity properties
            step_description: <Description of Task along with Potential Challenges and Proposed Solutions>
        - task_3:
            step_name: Definition of classes and properties in the ontology
            step_description: <Description of Task along with Potential Challenges and Proposed Solutions>
        - task_4:
            step_name: Establishment of constraints and relationships
            step_description: <Description of Task along with Potential Challenges and Proposed Solutions>
        - task_5:
            step_name: Inclusion of metadata and annotations
            step_description: <Description of Task along with Potential Challenges and Proposed Solutions>
        - task_6:
            step_name: Specification of a base prefix
            step_description: <Description of Task along with Potential Challenges and Proposed Solutions>
        - task_7:
            step_name: Definition of annotation properties
            step_description: <Description of Task along with Potential Challenges and Proposed Solutions>
    END
    Propose any additional tasks you deem necessary for the successful accomplishment of this project, and provide potential challenges along with proposed solutions for these.

    Output Instructions:
    Construct instructions for the next steps in the strategy, focusing on potential continuations of the previous tasks. The format should be as follows:
    START
        Instruction 1: <Provide an instruction for the next task in the plan, offering an alternative continuation based on the updated plan.>
        Instruction 2: <Provide a second instruction for the next task in the plan, suggesting a different alternative continuation.>
        Instruction 3: <Provide a third instruction for the next task in the plan, offering yet another possible direction.>
    FINISH

Ensure to conclude the Output Tasks with 'END' and the Output Instructions with 'FINISH'. Remember, the objective is to generate an actionable strategy, not to solve the task or generate code.
