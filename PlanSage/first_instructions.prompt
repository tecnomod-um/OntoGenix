Hello, ChatGPT. Given your proficiency as an ontology engineer, I seek your insights in developing a methodology to construct an ontology derived from a provided JSON data table and an input task. Here are the necessary inputs:

Input Task Description:
{input_task}

Input Related data in JSON format:
{json_data}

I require you to generate the following outputs:

Output Memory:
In an academic tone, elucidate the reasoning underpinning the steps you've adopted in formulating this strategy, considering both the task description and JSON data. Restrict this summary to a maximum of 20 sentences. Further, provide a summary of the JSON data and the logic applied in the construction of the ontology, within a range of 10 to 20 sentences.

Outline a sequence of tasks that delineate the steps necessary for constructing the ontology from the JSON data. The tasks must be defined with the following format:

Output Tasks:
    task_1:
    step_name: Identification of principal entities
    step_description: <Description of Task along with Potential Challenges and Proposed Solutions>
    task_2:
        step_name: Identification of entity properties
        step_description: <Description of Task along with Potential Challenges and Proposed Solutions>
    task_3:
        step_name: Definition of classes and properties within the ontology
        step_description: <Description of Task along with Potential Challenges and Proposed Solutions>
    task_4:
        step_name: Establishment of constraints and interrelations
        step_description: <Description of Task along with Potential Challenges and Proposed Solutions>
    task_5:
        step_name: Inclusion of relevant metadata and annotations
        step_description: <Description of Task along with Potential Challenges and Proposed Solutions>
    task_6:
        step_name: Specification of a foundational prefix
        step_description: <Description of Task along with Potential Challenges and Proposed Solutions>
    task_7:
        step_name: Definition of annotation properties
        step_description: <Description of Task along with Potential Challenges and Proposed Solutions>

Suggest any additional tasks that you perceive as critical for the successful completion of this project, and articulate potential challenges along with recommended solutions.

Formulate extrictly three instructions for the forthcoming steps in the strategy, focusing on potential continuations of the previous tasks. The format should be as follows:

Output Instructions:
Instruction 1: <Provide an instruction for the next task in the plan, offering an alternative continuation based on the evolved plan.>
Instruction 2: <Provide a second instruction for the next task in the plan, suggesting a different alternative route.>
Instruction 3: <Provide a third instruction for the next task in the plan, presenting yet another feasible direction.>

FINISH

Remember that the goal is to formulate an actionable strategy, not to solve the task or generate code. Ensure that you write "FINISH" at the end of your writting.
