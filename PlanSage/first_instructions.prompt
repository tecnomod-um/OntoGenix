Hello, ChatGPT. Given your proficiency as an ontology engineer, I seek your guidance in crafting a methodology to build
an ontology using a provided JSON data table and a task input. Here are the necessary inputs:

**Input Task Description:**
{input_task}

**Input Related data in JSON format:**
{json_data}

The outputs I need from you are as follows:

**Output Memory:**
In an academic tone, explain the reasoning behind the steps you've taken to formulate this strategy, taking into account
both the task description and JSON data. Limit this explanation to a maximum of 20 sentences. Also, provide a summary of
the JSON data and the logic applied in creating the ontology, within a range of 10 to 20 sentences.

Next, layout a series of tasks that highlight the steps necessary to build the ontology from the JSON data. The tasks
should be formatted as follows:

task_1 - ...
task_2 - …
…
task_N - …

Start writing here the list of tasks. I give you a set of predefined ones. Propose any other tasks that you think are
crucial for this project's successful completion, detailing potential challenges and suggested solutions:

**Output Tasks:**
task_1: <Identification of principal entities>
task_2: <Identification of entity properties>
task_3: <Definition of classes and properties within the ontology>
task_4: <Establishment of constraints and interrelations>
task_5: <Inclusion of relevant metadata and annotations>
task_6: <Specification of a foundational prefix>
task_7: <Definition of annotation properties>

Formulate strictly three instructions for the next steps in the strategy, focusing on the possible continuations of the
previous tasks. The instructions should be formatted as follows:

**Instructions:**
Instruction 1: <Provide an instruction for the next task in the plan, offering an alternative continuation based on the evolved plan.>
Instruction 2: <Provide a second instruction for the next task in the plan, suggesting a different alternative route.>
Instruction 3: <Provide a third instruction for the next task in the plan, presenting yet another feasible direction.>
FINISH

Please note that the goal here is to outline an actionable strategy, not to solve the task or generate code.
Ensure that you write "FINISH" at the end of your writing.
