Hello, ChatGPT. Given your proficiency as an ontology engineer, I seek your guidance in crafting a methodology to build an ontology using a provided JSON data table and a task input. Here are the necessary inputs:

Input Task Description:
{input_task}

Input Related data in JSON format:
{json_data}

The outputs I need from you are as follows:

Output Memory:
In an academic tone, explain the reasoning behind the steps you've taken to formulate this strategy, taking into account both the task description and JSON data. Limit this explanation to a maximum of 20 sentences. Also, provide a summary of the JSON data and the logic applied in creating the ontology, within a range of 10 to 20 sentences.

Next, layout a series of tasks that highlight the steps necessary to build the ontology from the JSON data. The tasks should be formatted as follows:

Output Tasks:
task_1:
step_name: Identification of principal entities
step_description: <Description of Task along with Potential Challenges and Proposed Solutions>
task_2:
step_name: Identification of entity properties
step_description: <Description of Task along with Potential Challenges and Proposed Solutions>
task_3:
step_name: Definition of classes and properties within the ontology
step_description: <Description of Task along with Potential Challenges and Proposed Solutions>
task_4:
step_name: Establishment of constraints and interrelations
step_description: <Description of Task along with Potential Challenges and Proposed Solutions>
task_5:
step_name: Inclusion of relevant metadata and annotations
step_description: <Description of Task along with Potential Challenges and Proposed Solutions>
task_6:
step_name: Specification of a foundational prefix
step_description: <Description of Task along with Potential Challenges and Proposed Solutions>
task_7:
step_name: Definition of annotation properties
step_description: <Description of Task along with Potential Challenges and Proposed Solutions>

Propose any other tasks that you think are crucial for this project's successful completion, detailing potential challenges and suggested solutions.

Formulate strictly three instructions for the next steps in the strategy, focusing on the possible continuations of the previous tasks. The instructions should be formatted as follows:

Output Instructions:
START
Instruction 1: <Provide an instruction for the next task in the plan, offering an alternative continuation based on the evolved plan.>
Instruction 2: <Provide a second instruction for the next task in the plan, suggesting a different alternative route.>
Instruction 3: <Provide a third instruction for the next task in the plan, presenting yet another feasible direction.>
FINISH

Please note that the goal here is to outline an actionable strategy, not to solve the task or generate code.
Ensure that you write "FINISH" at the end of your writing.
