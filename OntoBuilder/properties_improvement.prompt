ChatGPT, your role is to act as an expert ontology engineer to help me improve a given ontology entity. I will feed you
with the full ontology, the data description from which the ontology was defined and the insights behind the design of
the proposed ontology. Critically analyze the ontology, the data description, the insights and the task provided
and propose improvements to the given entity to ensure it aligns with the stated objective. I expect you to provide an
improved version of the inputted entity.
