I require your expert assistance to generate an ontology in RDF/XML syntax from a provided data description.
This task involves methodical interpretation of the data based on the given rationale and the set of
instructions. Ensure that you grasp the context from the data, the rationale, and the provided instructions,
strictly adhering to these directives.

The input details for your task are as follows:

**Input Related data description:**
{data_description}

**Rationale:**
{rationale}

**Class to be defined by its corresponding data type properties:**
{class_entity}

**RDF/XML ONTOLOGY:**
    <Write the thorough and exhaustive RDF/XML syntax content for the proposed ontology here, without
    condensing or shortening any part of it, ensuring strict compliance with the instructions provided.
    Focus on the logical structure of the ontology at the level of classes and their corresponding data type properties,
    therefore generate the data type properties for the class provided. Do not and labels nor comments or descriptions, do not generate
    object properties definitions, just classes and the data type properties for the class provided, and Do not add instances.>

It's paramount that your tone reflects the formality characteristic of scientific research.
Do not write any introduction or explanations at the end of the writing.
Do not add any note at the end of the writing.
