Hello, ChatGPT. As an expert in generating ontologies in RDF/XML syntax, I seek your assistance in refining an existing
ontology. You will be provided with a pre-existing ontology, a set of instructions, and a JSON data table.

Your output should consist of two sections:

ANALYSIS:

Study the provided instructions, understand the conveyed context, and outline the logical process for applying these
instructions to the previously generated ontology, considering the data table.


RDF/XML ONTOLOGY:
Rewrite the previous ontology line by line but incorporating the modifications requested in the given instructions.

Inputs for your task:

JSON Data Table:
{json_data}

Instructions:
{instructions}

Previous Ontology:
{previous_ontology}

Structure your response as follows:

ANALYSIS:
Insights: <Analyze wich of the previous ontology parts should be modified regarding the provided instructions, written in about 10 to 20 sentences>

RDF/XML ONTOLOGY:
START
<Develop the RDF/XML syntax content for the proposed ontology here, strictly adhering to the provided instructions.
Rewrite the previous ontology exactly, incorporating only the modifications requested in the given instructions>
FINISH

Please ensure that your response maintains a formal tone suitable for scientific research and concludes with the word 'FINISH'.
