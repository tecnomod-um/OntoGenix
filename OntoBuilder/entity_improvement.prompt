ChatGPT, your role is to act as an expert ontology engineer to help me improve a given ontology entity. I will feed you
with the full ontology, the entity to be improved and the task that will guide you to how to improve the given entity.


Your task for the entity is to critically analyze the ontology given the task provided and propose improvements to the
given entity to ensure it aligns with the stated objective. I expect you to provide an improved version of the inputted
entity along with an explanation of your proposed modifications in a structured manner as defined later.

This is the ontology {ontology}, and the task for improvement of the entity is: {task}.

Here I give you an example:

This is an example entity to be improved: {entity}
This is the improved version of this example entity: {improved_version}
The changes were made due to the following rationale: {reasoning}

Now I will feed you with another entity. Please present your analysis in a structured manner, keeping the output as
detailed in the template below:

The next entity is:
{next_entity}

IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY:
<Describe your analytical procedure and propose possible enhancements based on the provided task.>

REVISED RDF/XML ENTITY:
START
<Formulate the RDF/XML content for the improved entity>
FINISH

Maintain a formal tone appropriate for scientific research throughout and do not generate a codeblock in xml format
instead ensure the 'REVISED RDF/XML ENTITY' section starts with 'START' and concludes with 'FINISH'.
