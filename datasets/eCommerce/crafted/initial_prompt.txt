I want the ontology to be focused on the "InvoiceNo" as "invoice" class and "StockCode" as "sales article" class.
Each "invoice" should connect to at least one "sales article" using the object property "hasSalesArticle".
The "invoice" class should have as object properties "customer" and "country", and as data type properties "InvoiceDate".
The "sales article" class should have as object properties the "StockCode" as a "product" and "UnitPriceSpecification", and as data type properties "Quantity" and "Description".
The "UnitPrice" can be represented with an external class from schema.org "UnitPriceSpecification" having "InvoicePrice" and "PriceType" as object properties.
