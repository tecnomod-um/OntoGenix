    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">This gr:BusinessFunction indicates that the gr:BusinessEntity offers (or seeks) the respective type of service.

Note: Maintain and Repair are also types of Services. However, products and services ontologies often provide classes for tangible products as well as for types of services. The business function gr:ProvideService is to be used with such goods that are services, while gr:Maintain and gr:Repair can be used with goods for which only the class of product exists in the ontology, but not the respective type of service.

Example: Car maintenance could be expressed both as "provide the service car maintenance" or "maintain cars".</rdfs:comment>
