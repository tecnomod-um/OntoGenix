    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">This specifies the business function of the gr:Offering, i.e. whether the gr:BusinessEntity is offering to sell, to lease, or to repair the particular type of product. In the case of bundles, it is also possible to attach individual business functions to each gr:TypeAndQuantityNode. The business function of the main gr:Offering determines the business function for all included objects or services, unless a business function attached to a gr:TypeAndQuantityNode overrides it.
	
Note: While it is possible that an entity is offering multiple types of business functions for the same set of objects (e.g. rental and sales), this should usually not be stated by attaching multiple business functions to the same gr:Offering, since the gr:UnitPriceSpecification for the varying business functions will typically be very different.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">An instance of this class is an actual integer value for a quantitative property of a product. This instance is usually characterized by a minimal value, a maximal value, and a unit of measurement. 

Example: A seating capacity between 1 and 8 persons.

Note: Users must keep in mind that ranges in here mean that ALL possible values in this interval are covered. (Sometimes, the actual commitment may be less than that: "We sell cars from 2 - 12 seats" does often not really mean that they have cars with 2,3,4,...12 seats.). Someone renting out two types of rowing boats, one that fits for 1 or 2 people, and another that must be operated by 4 people cannot claim to rent boats with a seating capacity between 1 and 4 people. He or she is offering two boat types for 1-2 and 4 persons.
		
Compatibility with schema.org: This class is a subclass of http://schema.org/Quantity.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">The Stock Keeping Unit, or SKU is a unique identifier for a product, service, or bundle from the perspective of a particular supplier, i.e. SKUs are mostly assigned and serialized at the merchant level. 
Examples of SKUs are the ordering or parts numbers used by a particular Web shop or catalog.

Consequently, the domain of gr:hasStockKeepingUnit is the union of the classes gr:Offering and gr:ProductOrService. 
If attached to a gr:Offering, the SKU will usually reflect a merchant-specific identifier, i.e. one valid only for that particular retailer or shop. 
If attached to a gr:ProductOrServiceModel, the SKU can reflect either the identifier used by the merchant or the part number used by the official manufacturer of that part. For the latter, gr:hasMPN is a better choice.

Important: Be careful when assuming two products or services instances or offering instances to be identical based on the SKU. Since SKUs are unique only for the same gr:BusinessEntity, this can be assumed only when you are sure that the two SKU values refer to the same business entity. Such can be done by taking into account the provenance of the data. As long as instances of gr:Offering are concerned, you can also check that the offerings are being offered by the same gr:Business Entity.

Usually, the properties gr:hasEAN_UCC-13 and gr:hasGTIN-14 are much more reliable identifiers, because they are globally unique.
