Hello, ChatGPT. As an expert ontology engineer, I need your assistance in defining the ontology for a given dataset. The main classes are CustomerFeedback and EvaluationItem. The subclasses of EvaluationItem include ArrivalDelay, DepartureDelay, OnlineBoarding, SeatConfort, Departure, FoodAndDrink, GateLocation, Wifi, OnlineSupport, OnlineBooking, LegRoomService, CheckinService, and Cleanliness. These subclasses relates to a column in the dataset. The CustomerFeedback class is related to CustomerSatisfaction, CustomerGender, FlightClass, TypeOfTravel, and CustomerType, and has Age and FlightDistance as data type properties. CustomerGender has Male and Female as instances which relates to Gender in the dataset, FlightClass includes Business and Eco, TypeOfTravel consists of BusinessTravel and PersonalTravel, and CustomerType has DisloyalCustomer and LoyalCustomer. Each categorical rating in EvaluationItem relates to the same categorical values ranging from 0 to 5, where 0 indicates total dislike and 5 indicates total like. Please help me structure this ontology based on the provided JSON data.
