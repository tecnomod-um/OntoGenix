### **ANALYSIS:**
#### Data Description:
The provided JSON data represents customer satisfaction metrics associated with airlines services. It is a hierarchical and structured form of data where specific customer feedback attributes are identified by distinct keys. These keys embody various customer-specific attributes and evaluations such as "satisfaction", "Gender", "Customer Type", "Age", "Type of Travel", "Class", and "Flight Distance". Additionally, the data further incorporates customer evaluations on several service elements like "Seat comfort", "Departure/Arrival time convenient", "Food and drink", "Gate location", and "Inflight wifi service" among others. Each of these attributes is associated with a unique identifier, "2178", representing a specific customer feedback entry. Moreover, some attributes represent categorical data, like "Gender" and "Class", while others depict numerical data, such as "Age" and "Flight Distance". The evaluations of service elements are quantitatively represented, allowing a precise assessment of customer satisfaction. The meticulous structure of the JSON data facilitates a systematic extraction and transformation process to derive a structured and coherent ontology.

#### Insights:
The instructions elucidate a meticulous process of creating a structured ontology from the given JSON data, focusing on hierarchical classes, object properties, and data properties. A critical interpretation of these directives reveals a focus on transforming granular data into a structured ontology to ensure semantic accuracy and coherence. The logical application of these instructions involves identifying and classifying main and connected classes, extracting object and data properties, defining relationships, and specifying domains and ranges for each property. A potential challenge is maintaining the logical consistency and semantic accuracy during the transformation of JSON keys to object and data properties while ensuring the correct alignment with external ontologies. Another difficulty may arise in defining the domain and range for each property, ensuring that they are semantically accurate and logically consistent with the overall ontology structure. The adherence to the prescribed foundational prefix and the strict compliance with the web ontology language standards are paramount to maintain coherence and interoperability in the ontology creation process.

```

This RDF/XML syntax outlines a structured ontology adhering to the directives specified. It presents a robust foundation to further develop and integrate a comprehensive knowledge graph utilizing the data available in the JSON dataset. It maintains a clear hierarchy and structure, interconnecting classes and properties logically as envisaged in the rationale.


**Next Entity:**
    <owl:Class rdf:about="https://vocab.um.es#CustomerFeedback"/>

**Task:**
Scrutinize the ontology, the data description and the insights to identify intrinsic constraints and relationships.
Clearly follow the instructions given in the insights to define the contraints and relationships.
Do not forget to reference all the object properties and data properties mentioned in the insights as related with the given entity.
Do not forget to define for object properties restrictions the "onClass" parameter.
Do not forget to define for data type properties restrictions the "onDataRange" parameter.


**Output**
<Formulate the RDF/XML content for the **Entity** provided.>

You must directly encode the RDF/XML content of the given entity, not the entire ontology.
Do not write any explanations at the beggning of the writing.
Do not write any explanations at the end of the writing.
Do not add any note at the end of the writing.
