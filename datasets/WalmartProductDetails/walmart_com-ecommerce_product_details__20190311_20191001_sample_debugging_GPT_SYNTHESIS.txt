SYNTHESIS STRATEGY:
Insights: 

1. In the first analysis, the ontology was focused on modeling the core entities and properties related to products and customers. This approach provided a solid foundation for representing the essential aspects of the domain.

2. In the second analysis, additional classes and properties were introduced to capture more specific information, such as the country of origin for products and the sales article associated with a product. This expansion allowed for a more comprehensive representation of the domain.

3. Both analyses identified the need for representing textual descriptions of products and the use of global trade item numbers (GTINs) for product identification. These insights were considered crucial and were retained in the final improved ontology.

4. The second analysis introduced the concept of an invoice and a unit price specification. While these additions were relevant for certain use cases, they were not considered essential for the overall ontology and were therefore not included in the final improved ontology.

ONTOLOGY CHANGE SUMMARY:
The final improved ontology retains the core classes and properties from the previous versions, including Product, Brand, Category, Price, Size, Availability, Description, Gtin, Customer, City, State, and ZipCodePrefix. These classes and properties provide a comprehensive representation of the domain.

The final improved ontology also introduces the Country class and the hasCountry property to capture the country of origin for products. This addition enhances the ontology's ability to represent international trade and product sourcing.

The Invoice class and the UnitPriceSpecification class, introduced in the second analysis, were not considered essential for the overall ontology and were therefore not included in the final improved ontology. This decision was made to maintain a focus on the core entities and properties relevant to the domain.

Overall, the final improved ontology represents a refined and comprehensive model of the product and customer domain, incorporating key insights from the previous analyses while excluding non-essential elements.
