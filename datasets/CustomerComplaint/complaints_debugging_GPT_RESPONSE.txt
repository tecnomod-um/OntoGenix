**Input Task Description:**
Generate the steps required to generate an ontology given the input json data table.
The ontology will be centered around the "CustomerComplaint" entity, which will be linked to other entities such as "State", "Product", "ProblemOfComplaint", and "Company".
The ontology will also capture the hierarchical relationships between entities. For instance, "Product" will have "SubProduct" as an object property, and "ProblemOfComplaint" will have "ProblemSubCategory" as an object property. This hierarchical structure is important for capturing the granularity of the data.
The ontology will also capture the relationship between the "Company" and "CompanyResponse", with "Resolution" as an object property of "CompanyResponse". This will allow us to understand how companies respond to complaints and the outcomes of these responses.

The outputs I need from you are as follows:

**Rationale:**
In an academic tone, explain the reasoning behind the steps you've taken to formulate this strategy, taking into account
both the task description and JSON data. Limit this explanation to a maximum of 20 sentences. Also, provide a summary of
the JSON data and the logic applied in creating the ontology, within a range of 10 to 20 sentences.

Start writing here the list of tasks. I give you a set of predefined ones. Next, layout a
series of tasks that highlight the steps necessary to build the ontology from the JSON data. The tasks should be
formatted as follows::

**Output Global Tasks:**
task_1: <Identification of classes>
task_2: <Identification of object properties>
task_3: <Identification of data properties. Data properties should refer to type of values not relations.>
task_4: <Definition of a structure for the identified classes, subclasses, object properties and data properties.>
task_5: <Specification of a foundational prefix "https://vocab.um.es#" for the ontology to ensure a clear structure. Define it as an owl type.>
task_6: <Use of external ontologies to defines types, like: schema, XMLSchema#, owl, ...>
task_7:<Generate appropriate domain and range for each object or data type property>


Please note that the goal here is to outline an actionable strategy, not to solve the task or generate code.


######################################## LLM ANSWER: SHORT TERM MEMORY AND LIST OF TASKS ################################################################
**Rationale:**
The initial task, as gleaned from the provided JSON data and the input task description, entails modeling an ontology, with "CustomerComplaint" as the primary entity, interconnected with secondary entities and hierarchical relationships. Analyzing the JSON structure, one can discern the existence of distinct entities, hierarchies, and relationships. Our ontology aims to represent this richness faithfully. While the JSON format inherently lacks a semantic layer, an ontology will grant meaning to the data, making it understandable for both humans and machines. Establishing an ontology will provide the foundation for querying, reasoning, and extracting knowledge from the dataset. Further, object and data properties facilitate understanding the nature of relationships and attributes, respectively. Leveraging external ontologies ensures standardization, fostering data interoperability.

**Summary:**
The provided JSON data represents consumer complaints, detailing when and how complaints were submitted, the nature of the issues, company responses, and associated metadata. Each complaint is characterized by attributes like product, sub-product, issue, sub-issue, date, company response, etc. Our ontology construction task will initiate by identifying key classes from these attributes, followed by ascertaining object properties to denote relationships (e.g., Product to SubProduct). Concurrently, data properties will be identified to describe the datatype of specific attributes (e.g., "Date received" being of type date). The aim is to design an ontology that encompasses the hierarchy, granularity, and relationships inherent in the data.

**Output Global Tasks:**
task_1: Identification of classes
- Based on the JSON structure, identify primary entities (e.g., CustomerComplaint, State, Product, ProblemOfComplaint, and Company).

task_2: Identification of object properties
- Determine relationships between entities such as Product to SubProduct and ProblemOfComplaint to ProblemSubCategory.

task_3: Identification of data properties
- For each identified class, discern attributes that contain values rather than relationships, e.g., Date received, ZIP code, etc.

task_4: Definition of a structure for the identified classes, subclasses, object properties, and data properties
- Organize classes into a hierarchical structure following the relationships found in the JSON data. For instance, ProblemOfComplaint will be a superclass, with ProblemSubCategory as a subclass.

task_5: Specification of a foundational prefix for the ontology
- Define a foundational URI prefix as "https://vocab.um.es#" and set it as an owl type, ensuring that entities within our ontology can be uniquely identified and referenced.

task_6: Use of external ontologies
- For standardized datatypes and relationships, leverage existing ontology definitions such as schema.org, XMLSchema#, and owl.

task_7: Generate appropriate domain and range for each object or data type property
- For each property, define its domain (the class it belongs to) and range (the type or class it points to). For example, for the property "hasSubProduct", the domain might be "Product" and the range "SubProduct".

With these tasks, a foundational roadmap is set for converting the JSON data into a structured ontology that can be leveraged for knowledge representation, querying, and reasoning.

**ANALYSIS:**

**Data Description:**
The JSON data table provided is a structured representation of customer complaints. Each key-value pair in the JSON data represents a specific aspect of the complaint. The keys include 'Date received', 'Product', 'Sub-product', 'Issue', 'Sub-issue', 'Consumer complaint narrative', 'Company public response', 'Company', 'State', 'ZIP code', 'Tags', 'Consumer consent provided?', 'Submitted via', 'Date sent to company', 'Company response to consumer', 'Timely response?', 'Consumer disputed?', and 'Complaint ID'. The values associated with these keys provide specific details about each complaint, such as the date it was received, the product or service it relates to, the specific issue and sub-issue, the narrative of the complaint, the company's response, and other relevant details. Each complaint is identified by a unique ID.

**Insights:**
The instructions provided indicate that the task is to create an ontology that captures the relationships between the different aspects of the complaints represented in the JSON data. The ontology will be centered around the "CustomerComplaint" entity, which will be linked to other entities such as "State", "Product", "ProblemOfComplaint", and "Company". The ontology will also capture the hierarchical relationships between entities, such as the relationship between "Product" and "SubProduct", and "ProblemOfComplaint" and "ProblemSubCategory". This will require careful interpretation of the JSON data to identify these relationships. The ontology will also define appropriate data type properties for each class, which will require a thorough understanding of the data types represented in the JSON data. One potential challenge in this task is ensuring that the ontology accurately captures the granularity of the data, particularly in relation to the hierarchical relationships between entities. Another potential challenge is ensuring that the data is correctly typed, which will require careful consideration of the data types represented in the JSON data.

the proposed ontology. Critically analyze the ontology, the data description, the insights and the task provided
and propose improvements to the given entity to ensure it aligns with the stated objective. I expect you to provide an
improved version of the inputted entity.


**ANALYSIS:**

**Data Description:**
The JSON data table provided is a structured representation of customer complaints. Each key-value pair in the JSON data represents a specific aspect of the complaint. The keys include 'Date received', 'Product', 'Sub-product', 'Issue', 'Sub-issue', 'Consumer complaint narrative', 'Company public response', 'Company', 'State', 'ZIP code', 'Tags', 'Consumer consent provided?', 'Submitted via', 'Date sent to company', 'Company response to consumer', 'Timely response?', 'Consumer disputed?', and 'Complaint ID'. The values associated with these keys provide specific details about each complaint, such as the date it was received, the product or service it relates to, the specific issue and sub-issue, the narrative of the complaint, the company's response, and other relevant details. Each complaint is identified by a unique ID.

**Insights:**
The instructions provided indicate that the task is to create an ontology that captures the relationships between the different aspects of the complaints represented in the JSON data. The ontology will be centered around the "CustomerComplaint" entity, which will be linked to other entities such as "State", "Product", "ProblemOfComplaint", and "Company". The ontology will also capture the hierarchical relationships between entities, such as the relationship between "Product" and "SubProduct", and "ProblemOfComplaint" and "ProblemSubCategory". This will require careful interpretation of the JSON data to identify these relationships. The ontology will also define appropriate data type properties for each class, which will require a thorough understanding of the data types represented in the JSON data. One potential challenge in this task is ensuring that the ontology accurately captures the granularity of the data, particularly in relation to the hierarchical relationships between entities.

This RDF/XML syntax outlines a structured ontology adhering to the directives specified. It presents a robust foundation to further develop and integrate a comprehensive knowledge graph utilizing the data available in the JSON dataset. It maintains a clear hierarchy and structure, interconnecting classes and properties logically as envisaged in the rationale.


**Next Entity:**
<owl:Class rdf:about="https://vocab.um.es#sales_product"/>

**Task:**
Scrutinize the ontology, the data description and the insights to identify intrinsic constraints and relationships.
Clearly follow the instructions given in the insights to define the contraints and relationships.
Do not forget to reference all the object properties and data properties mentioned in the insights as related with the given entity.
Do not forget to define for object properties restrictions the "onClass" parameter.
Do not forget to define for data type properties restrictions the "onDataRange" parameter.


**Output**
<Formulate the RDF/XML content for the **Entity** provided.>

You must directly encode the RDF/XML content of the given entity, not the entire ontology.
Do not write any explanations at the beggning of the writing.
Do not write any explanations at the end of the writing.
Do not add any note at the end of the writing.

**Tasks**
task_1: Append relevant metadata and annotations to provide context, provenance, or additional insights for each entity. Do not change the original entity name.
task_2: Define a description field, propose an alternative name, and devise a set of five alternative labels to ensure comprehensiveness and flexibility in understanding and usage.
task_3: Consider to define equivalent properties if known or it exist in the ontology, otherwise, do not create fictional ones.

Now I will feed you with another entity.
