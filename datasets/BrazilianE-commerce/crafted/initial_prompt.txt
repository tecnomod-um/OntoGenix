I want the ontology to be focused on "customer_zip_code_prefix" as the "ZipCodePrefix" class, "customer_state" as "State" class, "customer_id" as "Customer" and "customer_city" as "City".
"State" class must have as an object property "hasCity" to link at least one city to each state.
"City" class must have as object properties "hasZipCodePrefix" and "hasState".
"ZipCodePrefix" class must have as an object property "hasCity".
"Customer" class must have as object properties "hasZipCodePrefix", "hasCity", and the data type property "hasCutomerRef".
