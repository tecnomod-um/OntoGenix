I want the ontology to be focused on the "Product" entity as the main class "sales_product". Each product will have the following object properties: "BrandName", "Brand", "Category", "eligibleQuantity", "SubCategory", "Image_Url", "Absolute_Url". We propose to add an external entity "hasOffer" from the schema.org ontology to be an object property of "sales_product". The entities "Price", "DiscountPrice", "priceCurrency" (from schema) and "Quantity" will be set as data type properties to the "offer" class.
