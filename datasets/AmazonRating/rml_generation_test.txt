Hello, ChatGPT. As an expert in ontology translation, I need your assistance to generate a mapping in RML format.
I'm providing you with an ontology and the rationalle describing the json data source and the insights describing the semantic structure of the ontology.
I want you to methodically follow the steps provided in the rationale.

The necessary inputs are as follows:

**ANALYSIS:**
**Data Description:**
The JSON data table, named "AmazonRating," is delineated into four distinct keys: "UserId," "ProductId," "Rating," and "Timestamp," each possessing unique identifiers (IDs) as sub-keys. These identifiers correlate with different users, products, ratings, and timestamps, respectively. For instance, the "UserId" key encompasses unique numeric IDs each paired with a distinct user string identifier. Analogously, the "ProductId" key includes unique numeric IDs corresponding to different product string identifiers. The "Rating" key is connected to numeric IDs, which are mapped to numerical values representing the product ratings given by users, signifying the quality or satisfaction level associated with the product. Lastly, the "Timestamp" key, similarly, is linked to numeric IDs with corresponding timestamp values, indicating the precise time at which the rating was given. This structured formation of data lays the foundation for deriving relevant entities and their relationships to construct a coherent and logically sound ontology.

**Insights:**
The task at hand involves translating the structured JSON data into a well-defined ontology, using the logical framework provided in the instructions. The methodology involves identifying primary classes such as "SalesOrder," "Customer," and "SalesArticle" from the data provided. A pivotal step is the meticulous creation of object properties "hasProduct" and "hasCustomer" to interlink the instances of "SalesOrder" to "SalesArticle" and "Customer," achieving semantic coherence. Specifying data properties to portray the attributes of class instances is also crucial, such as defining "Rating" and "Timestamp" for "SalesOrder," and "UserID" and "ProductID" for "Customer" and "SalesArticle," respectively. However, potential challenges may arise in maintaining the conceptual clarity and ensuring that each class and property is defined with the utmost precision to avoid semantic discrepancies. Further, meticulous attention must be paid to uphold the standard ontological methodologies, including defining clear structures, domains, ranges, and incorporating external ontologies to guarantee the ontology's semantic coherence and interoperability.

**RDF/XML ONTOLOGY:**

This RDF/XML syntax represents the ontology constructed meticulously based on the JSON data provided, ensuring semantic coherence and logical interconnection between classes, while strictly adhering to the foundational principles and standards of ontology engineering.


Structure your output in the following format:

<Generate the RML content here:
        Ensure that when creating the URIs of the instances, they are unique, combine columns if necessary and do not use "http://example.org".
        Ensure you add all the necessary prefixes at the beginning of the RML. Ensure you correctly add the references
        to the prefixes in each triple definition block.
        IMPORTANT!! The rml mapping will reference a CSV file not a JSON.
        Follow this format for the definition of classes mappings:

        <#TriplesMapEntity1> a rr:TriplesMap;
            rml:logicalSource [
                rml:source "csv_data.csv";
                rml:referenceFormulation ql:CSV
            ];
            rr:subjectMap [
                rr:template "EntityURI/{Entity1}";
            ];
            rr:predicateObjectMap [
                rr:predicate ex:Property;
                rr:objectMap [
                    rr:parentTriplesMap <#Property>;
                ];
            ].

        <#TriplesMapEntity2> a rr:TriplesMap;
            rml:logicalSource [
                rml:source "csv_data.csv";
                rml:referenceFormulation ql:CSV
            ];
            rr:subjectMap [
                rr:template "EntityURI/{Entity2}";
            ].

Do not explain your answer, just write the rml code. Do no write notes at the end of your writing.
Generate appropriate URIs and combine columns if necessary.
Do not use "http://example.org" or "http://example.com" instead make use of the base prefix.
Create a mapping for each class.
Do not forget to add the prefixes.
Do not shorten your answer.
