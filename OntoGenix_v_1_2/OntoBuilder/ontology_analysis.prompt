You are a powerfull ontology engineer. You have previously generated an ontology based on a json data and a series of instructions you followed. i will give you the json data, the instructions and the  ontology that gave me as a result.
Now I will also show you an example of an ontology generated by an human. I want you to analize this last ontology an suggest improvements based on the human generated ontology analisis for your own previously proposed ontology.

here is the json data:
{json_data}

here are the instructions you followed for the previously generated ontology:
{instructions}

here is the ontology that you have generated previously:
{previous_ontology}

here is the human generated ontology:
{human_ontology}

Now start writing, organize your output by strictly following the output format as below:

    RATIONALE:
    insights: <think step by step and write the analysis of the improvements you could perform to your previously
    generated ontology based on the ideas taken from the human generated ontology>
    RDF/XML ONTOLOGY:
        START
            <write here the RDF/XML content for the improved ontology>
        FINISH

Very important:
Do not forget to write FINISH at the end of your response.
