OfferShippingDetails represents information about shipping destinations.

Multiple of these entities can be used to represent different shipping rates for different destinations:

One entity for Alaska/Hawaii. A different one for continental US. A different one for all France.

Multiple of these entities can be used to represent different shipping costs and delivery times.

Two entities that are identical but differ in rate and time:

E.g. Cheaper and slower: $5 in 5-7 days
or Fast and expensive: $15 in 1-2 days.

additionalType

Text  or 
URL
An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org style guide.

disambiguatingDescription
