Associates an Event with a Schedule. There are circumstances where it is preferable to share a schedule for a series of
      repeating events rather than data on the individual events themselves. For example, a website or application might prefer to publish a schedule for a weekly
      gym class rather than provide data on every event. A schedule could be processed by applications to add forthcoming events to a calendar. An Event that
      is associated with a Schedule using this property should not have startDate or endDate properties. These are instead defined within the associated
      Schedule, this avoids any ambiguity for clients using the data. The property might have repeated values to specify different schedules, e.g. for different months
      or seasons.

An Event runs on the second Monday of every month, from 6pm-7:30pm. Because this kind of recurrence goes beyond that expressible using <a href="https://schema.org/DayOfWeek">https://schema.org/DayOfWeek</a>, it is specified instead using iCal's <a href="https://icalendar.org/iCalendar-RFC-5545/3-8-5-3-recurrence-rule.html">syntax for byDay recurrence rules</a>.
