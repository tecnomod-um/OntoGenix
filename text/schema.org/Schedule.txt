Schedule
A Schema.org Type


This term is in the "new" area - implementation feedback and adoption from applications and websites can help improve our definitions.

Check for open issues.




A schedule defines a repeating time period used to describe a regularly occurring Event. At a minimum a schedule will specify repeatFrequency which describes the interval between occurrences of the event. Additional information can be provided to specify the schedule more precisely.
      This includes identifying the day(s) of the week or month when the recurring event will take place, in addition to its start and end time. Schedules may also
      have start and end dates to indicate when they are active, e.g. to define a limited calendar of events.
 





PropertyExpected TypeDescription


Properties from 
    
    
    Schedule

byDay

DayOfWeek  or 
Text
Defines the day(s) of the week on which a recurring Event takes place. May be specified using either DayOfWeek, or alternatively Text conforming to iCal's syntax for byDay recurrence rules.
                
                
                
            


byMonth

Integer
Defines the month(s) of the year on which a recurring Event takes place. Specified as an Integer between 1-12. January is 1.
                
                
                
            


byMonthDay

Integer
Defines the day(s) of the month on which a recurring Event takes place. Specified as an Integer between 1-31.
                
                
                
            


byMonthWeek

Integer
Defines the week(s) of the month on which a recurring Event takes place. Specified as an Integer between 1-5. For clarity, byMonthWeek is best used in conjunction with byDay to indicate concepts like the first and third Mondays of a month.
                
                
                
            


duration

Duration
The duration of the item (movie, audio recording, event, etc.) in ISO 8601 date format.
                
                
                
            


endDate

Date  or 
DateTime
The end date and time of the item (in ISO 8601 date format).
                
                
                
            


endTime

DateTime  or 
Time
The endTime of something. For a reserved event or service (e.g. FoodEstablishmentReservation), the time that it is expected to end. For actions that span a period of time, when the action was performed. E.g. John wrote a book from January to December. For media, including audio and video, it's the time offset of the end of a clip within a larger file.

Note that Event uses startDate/endDate instead of startTime/endTime, even when describing dates with times. This situation may be clarified in future revisions.
                
                
                
            


exceptDate

Date  or 
DateTime
Defines a Date or DateTime during which a scheduled Event will not take place. The property allows exceptions to
      a Schedule to be specified. If an exception is specified as a DateTime then only the event that would have started at that specific date and time
      should be excluded from the schedule. If an exception is specified as a Date then any event that is scheduled for that 24 hour period should be
      excluded from the schedule. This allows a whole day to be excluded from the schedule without having to itemise every scheduled event.
                
                
                
            


repeatCount

Integer
Defines the number of times a recurring Event will take place.
                
                
                
            


repeatFrequency

Duration  or 
Text
Defines the frequency at which Events will occur according to a schedule Schedule. The intervals between
      events should be defined as a Duration of time.
                
                
                
            


scheduleTimezone

Text
Indicates the timezone for which the time(s) indicated in the Schedule are given. The value provided should be among those listed in the IANA Time Zone Database.
                
                
                
            


startDate

Date  or 
DateTime
The start date and time of the item (in ISO 8601 date format).
                
                
                
            


startTime

DateTime  or 
Time
The startTime of something. For a reserved event or service (e.g. FoodEstablishmentReservation), the time that it is expected to start. For actions that span a period of time, when the action was performed. E.g. John wrote a book from January to December. For media, including audio and video, it's the time offset of the start of a clip within a larger file.

Note that Event uses startDate/endDate instead of startTime/endTime, even when describing dates with times. This situation may be clarified in future revisions.
                
                
                
            



Properties from 
    
    
    Thing

additionalType

Text  or 
URL
An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org style guide.
                
                
                
            


alternateName

Text
An alias for the item.
                
                
                
            


description

Text  or 
TextObject
A description of the item.
                
                
                
            


disambiguatingDescription

Text
A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation.
                
                
                
            


identifier

PropertyValue  or 
Text  or 
URL
The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See background notes for more details.
                
                
                
            


image

ImageObject  or 
URL
An image of the item. This can be a URL or a fully described ImageObject.
                
                
                
            


mainEntityOfPage

CreativeWork  or 
URL
Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See background notes for details.
                
                
                Inverse property: 
    
    
    mainEntity



name

Text
The name of the item.
                
                
                
            


potentialAction

Action
Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role.
                
                
                
            


sameAs

URL
URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website.
                
                
                
            


subjectOf

CreativeWork  or 
Event
A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing.

    about



url

URL
URL of the item.
                
                
                
            



Instances of 
    
    
    Schedule  may appear as a value for the following properties

PropertyOn TypesDescription

courseSchedule

CourseInstance
Represents the length and pace of a course, expressed as a Schedule.
  

eventSchedule

Event
Associates an Event with a Schedule. There are circumstances where it is preferable to share a schedule for a series of
      repeating events rather than data on the individual events themselves. For example, a website or application might prefer to publish a schedule for a weekly
      gym class rather than provide data on every event. A schedule could be processed by applications to add forthcoming events to a calendar. An Event that
      is associated with a Schedule using this property should not have startDate or endDate properties. These are instead defined within the associated
      Schedule, this avoids any ambiguity for clients using the data. The property might have repeated values to specify different schedules, e.g. for different months
      or seasons.
