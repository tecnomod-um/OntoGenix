MeasurementMethodEnum
A Schema.org Enumeration Type


This term is in the "new" area - implementation feedback and adoption from applications and websites can help improve our definitions.

Enumeration(s) for use with measurementMethod.
 




Instances of 
    
    
    MeasurementMethodEnum  may appear as a value for the following properties

PropertyOn TypesDescription

measurementMethod

DataCatalog  or 
DataDownload  or 
Dataset  or 
Observation  or 
PropertyValue  or 
StatisticalVariable
A subproperty of measurementTechnique that can be used for specifying specific methods, in particular via MeasurementMethodEnum.
  

measurementTechnique

DataCatalog  or 
DataDownload  or 
Dataset  or 
Observation  or 
PropertyValue  or 
StatisticalVariable
A technique, method or technology used in an Observation, StatisticalVariable or Dataset (or DataDownload, DataCatalog), corresponding to the method used for measuring the corresponding variable(s) (for datasets, described using variableMeasured; for Observation, a StatisticalVariable). Often but not necessarily each variableMeasured will have an explicit representation as (or mapping to) an property such as those defined in Schema.org, or other RDF vocabularies and "knowledge graphs". In that case the subproperty of variableMeasured called measuredProperty is applicable.

The measurementTechnique property helps when extra clarification is needed about how a measuredProperty was measured. This is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but may have broader applicability; it is not intended as a full representation of measurement, but can often serve as a high level summary for dataset discovery. 

For example, if variableMeasured is: molecule concentration, measurementTechnique could be: "mass spectrometry" or "nmr spectroscopy" or "colorimetry" or "immunofluorescence". If the variableMeasured is "depression rating", the measurementTechnique could be "Zung Scale" or "HAM-D" or "Beck Depression Inventory". 

If there are several variableMeasured properties recorded for some given data object, use a PropertyValue for each variableMeasured and attach the corresponding measurementTechnique. The value can also be from an enumeration, organized as a MeasurementMetholdEnumeration.
