Check for open issues.




A DeliveryTimeSettings represents re-usable pieces of shipping information, relating to timing. It is designed for publication on an URL that may be referenced via the shippingSettingsLink property of an OfferShippingDetails. Several occurrences can be published, distinguished (and identified/referenced) by their different values for transitTimeLabel.

Properties from 
    
    
    DeliveryTimeSettings

deliveryTime

ShippingDeliveryTime
The total delay between the receipt of the order and the goods reaching the final customer.
                
                
                
            


isUnlabelledFallback

Boolean
This can be marked 'true' to indicate that some published DeliveryTimeSettings or ShippingRateSettings are intended to apply to all OfferShippingDetails published by the same merchant, when referenced by a shippingSettingsLink in those settings. It is not meaningful to use a 'true' value for this property alongside a transitTimeLabel (for DeliveryTimeSettings) or shippingLabel (for ShippingRateSettings), since this property is for use with unlabelled settings.
                
                
                
            


shippingDestination

DefinedRegion
indicates (possibly multiple) shipping destinations. These can be defined in several ways, e.g. postalCode ranges.
                
                
                
            


transitTimeLabel

Text
Label to match an OfferShippingDetails with a DeliveryTimeSettings (within the context of a shippingSettingsLink cross-reference).
                
                
                
            




Properties from 
    
    
    Thing

additionalType

Text  or 
URL
An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org style guide.

disambiguatingDescription

Text
A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation.
