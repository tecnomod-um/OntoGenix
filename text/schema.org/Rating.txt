Properties from 
    
    
    Rating

author

Organization  or 
Person
The author of this content or rating. Please note that author is special in that HTML 5 provides a special mechanism for indicating authorship via the rel tag. That is equivalent to this and may be used interchangeably.
                
                
                
            


bestRating

Number  or 
Text
The highest value allowed in this rating system. If bestRating is omitted, 5 is assumed.
                
                
                
            


ratingExplanation

Text
A short explanation (e.g. one to two sentences) providing background context and other information that led to the conclusion expressed in the rating. This is particularly applicable to ratings associated with "fact check" markup using ClaimReview.
                
                
                
            


ratingValue

Number  or 
Text
The rating for the content.

Usage guidelines:

Use values from 0123456789 (Unicode 'DIGIT ZERO' (U+0030) to 'DIGIT NINE' (U+0039)) rather than superficially similar Unicode symbols.
Use '.' (Unicode 'FULL STOP' (U+002E)) rather than ',' to indicate a decimal point. Avoid using these symbols as a readability separator.




reviewAspect

Text
This Review or Rating is relevant to this part or facet of the itemReviewed.
                
                
                
            


worstRating

Number  or 
Text
The lowest value allowed in this rating system. If worstRating is omitted, 1 is assumed.
                
                
                
            



Properties from 
    
    
    Thing

additionalType

Text  or 
URL
An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org style guide.
                
                
                
            


alternateName

Text
An alias for the item.
                
                
                
            


description

Text  or 
TextObject
A description of the item.
                
                
                
            


disambiguatingDescription

Text
A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation.
                
                
                
            


identifier

PropertyValue  or 
Text  or 
URL
The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See background notes for more details.

potentialAction
