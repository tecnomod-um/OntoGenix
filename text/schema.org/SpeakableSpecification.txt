A SpeakableSpecification indicates (typically via xpath or cssSelector) sections of a document that are highlighted as particularly speakable. Instances of this type are expected to be used primarily as values of the speakable property.

cssSelector

CssSelectorType
A CSS selector, e.g. of a SpeakableSpecification or WebPageElement. In the latter case, multiple matches within a page can constitute a single conceptual "Web page element".
                
                
                
            


xpath

XPathType
An XPath, e.g. of a SpeakableSpecification or WebPageElement. In the latter case, multiple matches within a page can constitute a single conceptual "Web page element".

    Thing

additionalType

Text  or 
URL
An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org style guide.

disambiguatingDescription

Text
A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation.

See background notes for more details.

    SpeakableSpecification  may appear as a value for the following properties

PropertyOn TypesDescription

speakable

Article  or 
WebPage
Indicates sections of a Web page that are particularly 'speakable' in the sense of being highlighted as being especially appropriate for text-to-speech conversion. Other sections of a page may also be usefully spoken in particular circumstances; the 'speakable' property serves to indicate the parts most likely to be generally useful for speech.

The speakable property can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator' values:

1.) id-value URL references - uses id-value of an element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of speakable has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned.

2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, e.g. via class attribute. Use the cssSelector property.

3.)  XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the xpath property.

For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this
we define a supporting type, SpeakableSpecification  which is defined to be a possible value of the speakable property.
