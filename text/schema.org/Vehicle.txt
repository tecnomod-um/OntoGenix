    Vehicle

accelerationTime

QuantitativeValue
The time needed to accelerate the vehicle from a given start velocity to a given target velocity.

Typical unit code(s): SEC for seconds

Note: There are unfortunately no standard unit codes for seconds/0..100 km/h or seconds/0..60 mph. Simply use "SEC" for seconds and indicate the velocities in the name of the QuantitativeValue, or use valueReference with a QuantitativeValue of 0..60 mph or 0..100 km/h to specify the reference speeds.

gtin

Text  or 
URL
A Global Trade Item Number (GTIN). GTINs identify trade items, including products and services, using numeric identification codes.

The GS1 digital link specifications express GTINs as URLs (URIs, IRIs, etc.). Details including regular expression examples can be found in, Section 6 of the GS1 URI Syntax specification; see also schema.org tracking issue for schema.org-specific discussion. A correct gtin value should be a valid GTIN, which means that it should be an all-numeric string of either 8, 12, 13 or 14 digits, or a "GS1 Digital Link" URL based on such a string. The numeric component should also have a valid GS1 check digit and meet the other rules for valid GTINs. See also GS1's GTIN Summary and Wikipedia for more details. Left-padding of the gtin values is not required or encouraged. The gtin property generalizes the earlier gtin8, gtin12, gtin13, and gtin14 properties.

Note also that this is a definition for how to include GTINs in Schema.org data, and not a definition of GTINs in general - see the GS1 documentation for authoritative details.

isFamilyFriendly

Boolean
Indicates whether this content is family friendly.
                
                
                
            


isRelatedTo

Product  or 
Service
A pointer to another, somehow related product (or multiple products).
                
                
                
            


isSimilarTo

Product  or 
Service
A pointer to another, functionally similar product (or multiple products).
                
                
                
            


isVariantOf

ProductGroup  or 
ProductModel
Indicates the kind of product that this is a variant of. In the case of ProductModel, this is a pointer (from a ProductModel) to a base product from which this product is a variant. It is safe to infer that the variant inherits all product features from the base model, unless defined locally. This is not transitive. In the case of a ProductGroup, the group description also serves as a template, representing a set of Products that vary on explicitly defined, specific dimensions only (so it defines both a set of variants, as well as which values distinguish amongst those variants). When used with ProductGroup, this property can apply to any Product included in the group.

itemCondition

OfferItemCondition

keywords

DefinedTerm  or

material

Product  or 
Text  or 
URL
A material that something is made from, e.g. leather, wool, cotton, paper.
                
                
                
            


mobileUrl

Text
The mobileUrl property is provided for specific situations in which data consumers need to determine whether one of several provided URLs is a dedicated 'mobile site'.

To discourage over-use, and reflecting intial usecases, the property is expected only on Product and Offer, rather than Thing. The general trend in web technology is towards responsive design in which content can be flexibly adapted to a wide range of browsing environments. Pages and sites referenced with the long-established url property should ideally also be usable on a wide variety of devices, including mobile phones. In most cases, it would be pointless and counter productive to attempt to update all url markup to use mobileUrl for more mobile-oriented pages. The property is intended for the case when items (primarily Product and Offer) have extra URLs hosted on an additional "mobile site" alongside the main one. It should not be taken as an endorsement of this publication style.
                
                
                
            


model

ProductModel  or 
Text
The model of the product. Use with the URL of a ProductModel or a textual representation of the model identifier. The URL of the ProductModel can be from an external source. It is recommended to additionally provide strong product identifiers via the gtin8/gtin13/gtin14 and mpn properties.
                
                
                
            


mpn

Text
The Manufacturer Part Number (MPN) of the product, or the product to which the offer refers.
                
                
                
            


negativeNotes

ItemList  or 
ListItem  or 
Text  or 
WebContent
Provides negative considerations regarding something, most typically in pro/con lists for reviews (alongside positiveNotes). For symmetry 

In the case of a Review, the property describes the itemReviewed from the perspective of the review; in the case of a Product, the product itself is being described. Since product descriptions 
tend to emphasise positive claims, it may be relatively unusual to find negativeNotes used in this way. Nevertheless for the sake of symmetry, negativeNotes can be used on Product.

The property values can be expressed either as unstructured text (repeated as necessary), or if ordered, as a list (in which case the most negative is at the beginning of the list).

offers

Demand  or 
Offer
An offer to provide this item—for example, an offer to sell a product, rent the DVD of a movie, perform a service, or give away tickets to an event. Use businessFunction to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a Demand. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer.

pattern

DefinedTerm  or

Properties from 
    
    
    Thing

additionalType

Text  or 
URL
An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org style guide.
