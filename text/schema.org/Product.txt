    Product

additionalProperty

PropertyValue
A property-value pair representing an additional characteristic of the entity, e.g. a product feature or another characteristic for which there is no matching property in schema.org.

Note: Publishers should be aware that applications designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. https://schema.org/width, https://schema.org/color, https://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically expect such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic property/value mechanism.

asin

Text  or 
URL
An Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN) is a 10-character alphanumeric unique identifier assigned by Amazon.com and its partners for product identification within the Amazon organization (summary from Wikipedia's article).

Note also that this is a definition for how to include ASINs in Schema.org data, and not a definition of ASINs in general - see documentation from Amazon for authoritative details.
ASINs are most commonly encoded as text strings, but the [asin] property supports URL/URI as potential values too.

countryOfOrigin

Country
The country of origin of something, including products as well as creative  works such as movie and TV content.

In the case of TV and movie, this would be the country of the principle offices of the production company or individual responsible for the movie. For other kinds of CreativeWork it is difficult to provide fully general guidance, and properties such as contentLocation and locationCreated may be more applicable.

In the case of products, the country of origin of the product. The exact interpretation of this may vary by context and product type, and cannot be fully enumerated here.

gtin

Text  or 
URL
A Global Trade Item Number (GTIN). GTINs identify trade items, including products and services, using numeric identification codes.

The GS1 digital link specifications express GTINs as URLs (URIs, IRIs, etc.). Details including regular expression examples can be found in, Section 6 of the GS1 URI Syntax specification; see also schema.org tracking issue for schema.org-specific discussion. A correct gtin value should be a valid GTIN, which means that it should be an all-numeric string of either 8, 12, 13 or 14 digits, or a "GS1 Digital Link" URL based on such a string. The numeric component should also have a valid GS1 check digit and meet the other rules for valid GTINs. See also GS1's GTIN Summary and Wikipedia for more details. Left-padding of the gtin values is not required or encouraged. The gtin property generalizes the earlier gtin8, gtin12, gtin13, and gtin14 properties.

Note also that this is a definition for how to include GTINs in Schema.org data, and not a definition of GTINs in general - see the GS1 documentation for authoritative details.
                
                
                
            


gtin12

Text
The GTIN-12 code of the product, or the product to which the offer refers. The GTIN-12 is the 12-digit GS1 Identification Key composed of a U.P.C. Company Prefix, Item Reference, and Check Digit used to identify trade items. See GS1 GTIN Summary for more details.
                
                
                
            


gtin13

Text
The GTIN-13 code of the product, or the product to which the offer refers. This is equivalent to 13-digit ISBN codes and EAN UCC-13. Former 12-digit UPC codes can be converted into a GTIN-13 code by simply adding a preceding zero. See GS1 GTIN Summary for more details.
                
                
                
            


gtin14

Text
The GTIN-14 code of the product, or the product to which the offer refers. See GS1 GTIN Summary for more details.
                
                
                
            


gtin8

Text
The GTIN-8 code of the product, or the product to which the offer refers. This code is also known as EAN/UCC-8 or 8-digit EAN. See GS1 GTIN Summary for more details.

hasMeasurement

QuantitativeValue
A product measurement, for example the inseam of pants, the wheel size of a bicycle, or the gauge of a screw. Usually an exact measurement, but can also be a range of measurements for adjustable products, for example belts and ski bindings.

inProductGroupWithID

Text
Indicates the productGroupID for a ProductGroup that this product isVariantOf.
                
                
                
            


isAccessoryOrSparePartFor

Product
A pointer to another product (or multiple products) for which this product is an accessory or spare part.
                
                
                
            


isConsumableFor

Product
A pointer to another product (or multiple products) for which this product is a consumable.
                
                
                
            


isFamilyFriendly

Boolean
Indicates whether this content is family friendly.
                
                
                
            


isRelatedTo

Product  or 
Service
A pointer to another, somehow related product (or multiple products).

A pointer to another, functionally similar product (or multiple products).
                
                
                
            


isVariantOf

ProductGroup  or 
ProductModel
Indicates the kind of product that this is a variant of. In the case of ProductModel, this is a pointer (from a ProductModel) to a base product from which this product is a variant. It is safe to infer that the variant inherits all product features from the base model, unless defined locally. This is not transitive. In the case of a ProductGroup, the group description also serves as a template, representing a set of Products that vary on explicitly defined, specific dimensions only (so it defines both a set of variants, as well as which values distinguish amongst those variants). When used with ProductGroup, this property can apply to any Product included in the group.
                
                
                Inverse property: 
    
    
    hasVariant



itemCondition

OfferItemCondition

Also used for product return policies to specify the condition of products accepted for returns.
                
                
                
            


keywords

DefinedTerm  or 
Text  or 
URL
Keywords or tags used to describe some item. Multiple textual entries in a keywords list are typically delimited by commas, or by repeating the property.
                
                
                
            


logo

ImageObject  or 
URL
An associated logo.
                
                
                
            


manufacturer

Organization

material

Product  or 
Text  or 
URL
A material that something is made from, e.g. leather, wool, cotton, paper.
                
                
                
            


mobileUrl

Text
The mobileUrl property is provided for specific situations in which data consumers need to determine whether one of several provided URLs is a dedicated 'mobile site'.

To discourage over-use, and reflecting intial usecases, the property is expected only on Product and Offer, rather than Thing. The general trend in web technology is towards responsive design in which content can be flexibly adapted to a wide range of browsing environments. Pages and sites referenced with the long-established url property should ideally also be usable on a wide variety of devices, including mobile phones. In most cases, it would be pointless and counter productive to attempt to update all url markup to use mobileUrl for more mobile-oriented pages. The property is intended for the case when items (primarily Product and Offer) have extra URLs hosted on an additional "mobile site" alongside the main one. It should not be taken as an endorsement of this publication style.
                
                
                
            


model

ProductModel  or 
Text
The model of the product. Use with the URL of a ProductModel or a textual representation of the model identifier. The URL of the ProductModel can be from an external source. It is recommended to additionally provide strong product identifiers via the gtin8/gtin13/gtin14 and mpn properties.
                
                
                
            


mpn

Text
The Manufacturer Part Number (MPN) of the product, or the product to which the offer refers.
                
                
                
            


negativeNotes

ItemList  or 
ListItem  or 
Text  or 
WebContent
Provides negative considerations regarding something, most typically in pro/con lists for reviews (alongside positiveNotes). For symmetry 

In the case of a Review, the property describes the itemReviewed from the perspective of the review; in the case of a Product, the product itself is being described. Since product descriptions 
tend to emphasise positive claims, it may be relatively unusual to find negativeNotes used in this way. Nevertheless for the sake of symmetry, negativeNotes can be used on Product.

The property values can be expressed either as unstructured text (repeated as necessary), or if ordered, as a list (in which case the most negative is at the beginning of the list).

offers

Demand  or 
Offer
An offer to provide this item—for example, an offer to sell a product, rent the DVD of a movie, perform a service, or give away tickets to an event. Use businessFunction to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a Demand. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer.
                
                
                Inverse property: 
    
    
    itemOffered



pattern

DefinedTerm  or 
Text

ListItem  or 
Text  or 
WebContent

Properties from 
    
    
    Thing

additionalType

Text  or 
URL
An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org style guide.
