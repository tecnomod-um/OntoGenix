PropertyOn TypesDescription

gender

Person  or 
SportsTeam
Gender of something, typically a Person, but possibly also fictional characters, animals, etc. While https://schema.org/Male and https://schema.org/Female may be used, text strings are also acceptable for people who do not identify as a binary gender. The gender property can also be used in an extended sense to cover e.g. the gender of sports teams. As with the gender of individuals, we do not try to enumerate all possibilities. A mixed-gender SportsTeam can be indicated with a text value of "Mixed".
