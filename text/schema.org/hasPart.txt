                       Schema Bib Extend Group
                    



                    The W3C Schema Bib Extend (BibEx) group led the work to improve schema.org for bibliographic information, including terms for periodicals, articles and multi-volume works. The design was inspired in places (e.g. pageStart, pageEnd, pagination) by the Bibliographic Ontology, 'bibo'.
