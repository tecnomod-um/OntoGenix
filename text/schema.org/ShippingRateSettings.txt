Check for open issues.




A ShippingRateSettings represents re-usable pieces of shipping information. It is designed for publication on an URL that may be referenced via the shippingSettingsLink property of an OfferShippingDetails. Several occurrences can be published, distinguished and matched (i.e. identified/referenced) by their different values for shippingLabel.
 





PropertyExpected TypeDescription


Properties from 
    
    
    ShippingRateSettings

doesNotShip

Boolean
Indicates when shipping to a particular shippingDestination is not available.
                
                
                
            


freeShippingThreshold

DeliveryChargeSpecification  or 
MonetaryAmount
A monetary value above (or at) which the shipping rate becomes free. Intended to be used via an OfferShippingDetails with shippingSettingsLink matching this ShippingRateSettings.
                
                
                
            


isUnlabelledFallback

Boolean
This can be marked 'true' to indicate that some published DeliveryTimeSettings or ShippingRateSettings are intended to apply to all OfferShippingDetails published by the same merchant, when referenced by a shippingSettingsLink in those settings. It is not meaningful to use a 'true' value for this property alongside a transitTimeLabel (for DeliveryTimeSettings) or shippingLabel (for ShippingRateSettings), since this property is for use with unlabelled settings.
                
                
                
            


shippingDestination

DefinedRegion
indicates (possibly multiple) shipping destinations. These can be defined in several ways, e.g. postalCode ranges.
                
                
                
            


shippingLabel

Text
Label to match an OfferShippingDetails with a ShippingRateSettings (within the context of a shippingSettingsLink cross-reference).
                
                
                
            


shippingRate

MonetaryAmount
The shipping rate is the cost of shipping to the specified destination. Typically, the maxValue and currency values (of the MonetaryAmount) are most appropriate.
                
                
                
            




Properties from 
    
    
    Thing

additionalType

Text  or 
URL
An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org style guide.

disambiguatingDescription

Text
A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation.
