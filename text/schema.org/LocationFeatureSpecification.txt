Properties from 
    
    
    PropertyValue

maxValue

Number
The upper value of some characteristic or property.
                
                
                
            


measurementMethod

DefinedTerm  or 
MeasurementMethodEnum  or 
Text  or 
URL
A subproperty of measurementTechnique that can be used for specifying specific methods, in particular via MeasurementMethodEnum.
                
                
                
            


measurementTechnique

DefinedTerm  or 
MeasurementMethodEnum  or 
Text  or 
URL
A technique, method or technology used in an Observation, StatisticalVariable or Dataset (or DataDownload, DataCatalog), corresponding to the method used for measuring the corresponding variable(s) (for datasets, described using variableMeasured; for Observation, a StatisticalVariable). Often but not necessarily each variableMeasured will have an explicit representation as (or mapping to) an property such as those defined in Schema.org, or other RDF vocabularies and "knowledge graphs". In that case the subproperty of variableMeasured called measuredProperty is applicable.

The measurementTechnique property helps when extra clarification is needed about how a measuredProperty was measured. This is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but may have broader applicability; it is not intended as a full representation of measurement, but can often serve as a high level summary for dataset discovery. 

For example, if variableMeasured is: molecule concentration, measurementTechnique could be: "mass spectrometry" or "nmr spectroscopy" or "colorimetry" or "immunofluorescence". If the variableMeasured is "depression rating", the measurementTechnique could be "Zung Scale" or "HAM-D" or "Beck Depression Inventory". 

If there are several variableMeasured properties recorded for some given data object, use a PropertyValue for each variableMeasured and attach the corresponding measurementTechnique. The value can also be from an enumeration, organized as a MeasurementMetholdEnumeration.
                
                
                
            


minValue

Number
The lower value of some characteristic or property.
                
                
                
            


propertyID

Text  or 
URL
A commonly used identifier for the characteristic represented by the property, e.g. a manufacturer or a standard code for a property. propertyID can be
(1) a prefixed string, mainly meant to be used with standards for product properties; (2) a site-specific, non-prefixed string (e.g. the primary key of the property or the vendor-specific ID of the property), or (3)
a URL indicating the type of the property, either pointing to an external vocabulary, or a Web resource that describes the property (e.g. a glossary entry).
Standards bodies should promote a standard prefix for the identifiers of properties from their standards.
                
                
                
            


unitCode

Text  or 
URL
The unit of measurement given using the UN/CEFACT Common Code (3 characters) or a URL. Other codes than the UN/CEFACT Common Code may be used with a prefix followed by a colon.
                
                
                
            


unitText

Text
A string or text indicating the unit of measurement. Useful if you cannot provide a standard unit code for
unitCode.
                
                
                
            


value

Boolean  or 
Number  or 
StructuredValue  or 
Text
The value of a QuantitativeValue (including Observation) or property value node.

For QuantitativeValue and MonetaryAmount, the recommended type for values is 'Number'.
For PropertyValue, it can be 'Text', 'Number', 'Boolean', or 'StructuredValue'.
Use values from 0123456789 (Unicode 'DIGIT ZERO' (U+0030) to 'DIGIT NINE' (U+0039)) rather than superficially similar Unicode symbols.
Use '.' (Unicode 'FULL STOP' (U+002E)) rather than ',' to indicate a decimal point. Avoid using these symbols as a readability separator.




valueReference

DefinedTerm  or 
Enumeration  or 
MeasurementTypeEnumeration  or 
PropertyValue  or 
QualitativeValue  or 
QuantitativeValue  or 
StructuredValue  or 
Text
A secondary value that provides additional information on the original value, e.g. a reference temperature or a type of measurement.
                
                
                
            




Properties from 
    
    
    Thing

additionalType

Text  or 
URL
An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org style guide.

disambiguatingDescription

Text
A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation.

PropertyValue  or 
Text  or

The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See background notes for more details.
