Check for open issues.




When a single product is associated with multiple offers (for example, the same pair of shoes is offered by different merchants), then AggregateOffer can be used.

Note: AggregateOffers are normally expected to associate multiple offers that all share the same defined businessFunction value, or default to http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#Sell if businessFunction is not explicitly defined.
 





PropertyExpected TypeDescription


Properties from 
    
    
    AggregateOffer

highPrice

Number  or 
Text
The highest price of all offers available.

Usage guidelines:

Use values from 0123456789 (Unicode 'DIGIT ZERO' (U+0030) to 'DIGIT NINE' (U+0039)) rather than superficially similar Unicode symbols.
Use '.' (Unicode 'FULL STOP' (U+002E)) rather than ',' to indicate a decimal point. Avoid using these symbols as a readability separator.




lowPrice

Number  or 
Text
The lowest price of all offers available.

Usage guidelines:

Use values from 0123456789 (Unicode 'DIGIT ZERO' (U+0030) to 'DIGIT NINE' (U+0039)) rather than superficially similar Unicode symbols.
Use '.' (Unicode 'FULL STOP' (U+002E)) rather than ',' to indicate a decimal point. Avoid using these symbols as a readability separator.

offers

Demand  or 
Offer
An offer to provide this item—for example, an offer to sell a product, rent the DVD of a movie, perform a service, or give away tickets to an event. Use businessFunction to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a Demand. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer.

gtin

Text  or 
URL
A Global Trade Item Number (GTIN). GTINs identify trade items, including products and services, using numeric identification codes.

The GS1 digital link specifications express GTINs as URLs (URIs, IRIs, etc.). Details including regular expression examples can be found in, Section 6 of the GS1 URI Syntax specification; see also schema.org tracking issue for schema.org-specific discussion. A correct gtin value should be a valid GTIN, which means that it should be an all-numeric string of either 8, 12, 13 or 14 digits, or a "GS1 Digital Link" URL based on such a string. The numeric component should also have a valid GS1 check digit and meet the other rules for valid GTINs. See also GS1's GTIN Summary and Wikipedia for more details. Left-padding of the gtin values is not required or encouraged. The gtin property generalizes the earlier gtin8, gtin12, gtin13, and gtin14 properties.

Note also that this is a definition for how to include GTINs in Schema.org data, and not a definition of GTINs in general - see the GS1 documentation for authoritative details.

gtin13

Text
The GTIN-13 code of the product, or the product to which the offer refers. This is equivalent to 13-digit ISBN codes and EAN UCC-13. Former 12-digit UPC codes can be converted into a GTIN-13 code by simply adding a preceding zero. See GS1 GTIN Summary for more details.

itemOffered

AggregateOffer  or 
CreativeWork  or 
Event  or 
MenuItem  or 
Product  or 
Service  or 
Trip
An item being offered (or demanded). The transactional nature of the offer or demand is documented using businessFunction, e.g. sell, lease etc. While several common expected types are listed explicitly in this definition, others can be used. Using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer.
                
                
                Inverse property: 
    
    
    offers



leaseLength

Duration  or 
QuantitativeValue
Length of the lease for some Accommodation, either particular to some Offer or in some cases intrinsic to the property.
                
                
                
            


mobileUrl

Text
The mobileUrl property is provided for specific situations in which data consumers need to determine whether one of several provided URLs is a dedicated 'mobile site'.

To discourage over-use, and reflecting intial usecases, the property is expected only on Product and Offer, rather than Thing. The general trend in web technology is towards responsive design in which content can be flexibly adapted to a wide range of browsing environments. Pages and sites referenced with the long-established url property should ideally also be usable on a wide variety of devices, including mobile phones. In most cases, it would be pointless and counter productive to attempt to update all url markup to use mobileUrl for more mobile-oriented pages. The property is intended for the case when items (primarily Product and Offer) have extra URLs hosted on an additional "mobile site" alongside the main one. It should not be taken as an endorsement of this publication style.

                Inverse property: 
    
    
    makesOffer



price

Number  or 
Text
The offer price of a product, or of a price component when attached to PriceSpecification and its subtypes.

Usage guidelines:

Use the priceCurrency property (with standard formats: ISO 4217 currency format, e.g. "USD"; Ticker symbol for cryptocurrencies, e.g. "BTC"; well known names for Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS) and other currency types, e.g. "Ithaca HOUR") instead of including ambiguous symbols such as '$' in the value.
Use '.' (Unicode 'FULL STOP' (U+002E)) rather than ',' to indicate a decimal point. Avoid using these symbols as a readability separator.
Note that both RDFa and Microdata syntax allow the use of a "content=" attribute for publishing simple machine-readable values alongside more human-friendly formatting.
Use values from 0123456789 (Unicode 'DIGIT ZERO' (U+0030) to 'DIGIT NINE' (U+0039)) rather than superficially similar Unicode symbols.

Properties from 
    
    
    Thing

additionalType

Text  or 
URL
An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org style guide.
