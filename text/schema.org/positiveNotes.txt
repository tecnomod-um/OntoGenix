Provides positive considerations regarding something, for example product highlights or (alongside negativeNotes) pro/con lists for reviews.

In the case of a Review, the property describes the itemReviewed from the perspective of the review; in the case of a Product, the product itself is being described.

The property values can be expressed either as unstructured text (repeated as necessary), or if ordered, as a list (in which case the most positive is at the beginning of the list).
