Schema.org Section: attic
Schema.org is a set of extensible schemas that enables webmasters to embed structured data on their web pages for use by search engines and other applications.
For more details, see the homepage.



  The attic area is an archive area for terms which are no longer part of the core vocabulary or its extensions. Attic terms are preserved here to satisfy previous links to them.

Implementors and publishers are gently encouraged not to use terms in the attic area.
