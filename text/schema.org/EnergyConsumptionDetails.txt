EnergyConsumptionDetails represents information related to the energy efficiency of a product that consumes energy. The information that can be provided is based on international regulations such as for example EU directive 2017/1369 for energy labeling and the Energy labeling rule under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) in the US.

energyEfficiencyScaleMax

EUEnergyEfficiencyEnumeration
Specifies the most energy efficient class on the regulated EU energy consumption scale for the product category a product belongs to. For example, energy consumption for televisions placed on the market after January 1, 2020 is scaled from D to A+++.
                
                
                
            


energyEfficiencyScaleMin

EUEnergyEfficiencyEnumeration
Specifies the least energy efficient class on the regulated EU energy consumption scale for the product category a product belongs to. For example, energy consumption for televisions placed on the market after January 1, 2020 is scaled from D to A+++.
                
                
                
            


hasEnergyEfficiencyCategory

EnergyEfficiencyEnumeration
Defines the energy efficiency Category (which could be either a rating out of range of values or a yes/no certification) for a product according to an international energy efficiency standard.

    Thing

additionalType

Text  or 
URL
An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org style guide.
