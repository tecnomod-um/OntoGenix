Check for open issues.




A series of Events. Included events can relate with the series using the superEvent property.

An EventSeries is a collection of events that share some unifying characteristic. For example, "The Olympic Games" is a series, which
is repeated regularly. The "2012 London Olympics" can be presented both as an Event in the series "Olympic Games", and as an
EventSeries that included a number of sporting competitions as Events.

The nature of the association between the events in an EventSeries can vary, but typical examples could
include a thematic event series (e.g. topical meetups or classes), or a series of regular events that share a location, attendee group and/or organizers.

EventSeries has been defined as a kind of Event to make it easy for publishers to use it in an Event context without
worrying about which kinds of series are really event-like enough to call an Event. In general an EventSeries
may seem more Event-like when the period of time is compact and when aspects such as location are fixed, but
it may also sometimes prove useful to describe a longer-term series as an Event.

eventSchedule

Schedule
Associates an Event with a Schedule. There are circumstances where it is preferable to share a schedule for a series of
      repeating events rather than data on the individual events themselves. For example, a website or application might prefer to publish a schedule for a weekly
      gym class rather than provide data on every event. A schedule could be processed by applications to add forthcoming events to a calendar. An Event that
      is associated with a Schedule using this property should not have startDate or endDate properties. These are instead defined within the associated
      Schedule, this avoids any ambiguity for clients using the data. The property might have repeated values to specify different schedules, e.g. for different months
      or seasons.

Properties from 
    
    
    Thing

additionalType

Text  or 
URL
An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org style guide.
