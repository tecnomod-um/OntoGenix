Welcome to Schema.org

            Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create,
            maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the
            Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond.
        

            Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings,
            including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. These vocabularies cover
            entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can
            easily be extended through a well-documented extension model. Over 10 million sites use
            Schema.org to markup their web pages and email messages.
            Many applications from Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others
            already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences.
        

            Founded by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex,
            Schema.org vocabularies are developed by an open community process,
            using the public-schemaorg@w3.org
             mailing list and through GitHub.
        

           A shared vocabulary makes it easier for webmasters and developers to decide
           on a schema and get the maximum benefit for their efforts.
           It is in this spirit that the founders, together with the
           larger community have come together - to provide a shared collection of schemas.
