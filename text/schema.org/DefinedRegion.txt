A DefinedRegion is a geographic area defined by potentially arbitrary (rather than political, administrative or natural geographical) criteria. Properties are provided for defining a region by reference to sets of postal codes.

Examples: a delivery destination when shopping. Region where regional pricing is configured.

Requirement 1:
Country: US
States: "NY", "CA"

Requirement 2:
Country: US
PostalCode Set: { [94000-94585], [97000, 97999], [13000, 13599]}
{ [12345, 12345], [78945, 78945], }
Region = state, canton, prefecture, autonomous community...

Properties from 
    
    
    Thing

additionalType

Text  or 
URL
An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org style guide.

disambiguatingDescription
