The content of a claim can be summarized with the <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/text">text</a> property. Variations on well known claims can have their common identity indicated via <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/sameAs">sameAs</a> links, and summarized with a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/name">name</a>. Ideally, a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Claim">Claim</a> description includes enough contextual information to minimize the risk of ambiguity or inclarity. In practice, many claims are better understood in the context in which they appear or the interpretations provided by claim reviews.<br/><br/>

Individual comic issues are serially published as

        series to which the issue belongs; the issue number; and the variant
        description of the issue (if any).

This is the equivalent of Atom's element as defined in Feed Paging and Archiving <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5005">RFC 5005</a>, for example (and as defined for Atom), when using data from a feed that represents a collection of items that varies over time (e.g. "Top Twenty Records") there is no need to have newer entries mixed in alongside older, obsolete entries. By marking this feed as a CompleteDataFeed, old entries can be safely discarded when the feed is refreshed, since we can assume the feed has provided descriptions for all current items.

CovidTestingFacility

A CovidTestingFacility is a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/MedicalClinic">MedicalClinic</a> where testing for the COVID-19 Coronavirus
      disease is available. If the facility is being made available from an established <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Pharmacy">Pharmacy</a>, <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Hotel">Hotel</a>, or other
      non-medical organization, multiple types can be listed. This makes it easier to re-use existing schema.org information
      about that place, e.g. contact info, address, opening hours. Note that in an emergency, such information may not always be reliable.

CreativeWorkSeries


A CreativeWorkSeries in schema.org is a group of related items, typically but not necessarily of the same kind. CreativeWorkSeries are usually organized into some order, often chronological. Unlike <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/ItemList">ItemList</a> which is a general purpose data structure for lists of things, the emphasis with CreativeWorkSeries is on published materials (written e.g. books and periodicals, or media such as TV, radio and games).<br/><br/>

Specific subtypes are available for describing <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/TVSeries">TVSeries</a>, <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/RadioSeries">RadioSeries</a>, <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/MovieSeries">MovieSeries</a>, <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/BookSeries">BookSeries</a>, <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Periodical">Periodical</a> and <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/VideoGameSeries">VideoGameSeries</a>. In each case, the <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/hasPart">hasPart</a> / <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/isPartOf">isPartOf</a> properties can be used to relate the CreativeWorkSeries to its parts. The general CreativeWorkSeries type serves largely just to organize these more specific and practical subtypes.<br/><br/>

It is common for properties applicable to an item from the series to be usefully applied to the containing group. Schema.org attempts to anticipate some of these cases, but publishers should be free to apply properties of the series parts to the series as a whole wherever they seem appropriate.

For simpler, casually written user/visitor/viewer/customer reviews, it is more appropriate to use the <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/UserReview">UserReview</a> type.

some <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/agent">agent</a>. As is common elsewhere in schema.org, it is sometimes more useful to describe the results of such an action without explicitly describing the <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Action">Action</a>.<br/><br/>

An <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/EndorsementRating">EndorsementRating</a> may be part of a numeric scale or organized system, but this is not required: having an explicit type for indicating a positive,
endorsement rating is particularly useful in the absence of numeric scales as it helps consumers understand that the rating is broadly positive.

An EventSeries is a collection of events that share some unifying characteristic. For example, "The Olympic Games" is a series, which
is repeated regularly. The "2012 London Olympics" can be presented both as an <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Event">Event</a> in the series "Olympic Games", and as an
<a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/EventSeries">EventSeries</a> that included a number of sporting competitions as Events.<br/><br/>

The nature of the association between the events in an <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/EventSeries">EventSeries</a> can vary, but typical examples could
include a thematic event series (e.g. topical meetups or classes), or a series of regular events that share a location, attendee group and/or organizers.<br/><br/>

EventSeries has been defined as a kind of Event to make it easy for publishers to use it in an Event context without
worrying about which kinds of series are really event-like enough to call an Event. In general an EventSeries
may seem more Event-like when the period of time is compact and when aspects such as location are fixed, but
it may also sometimes prove useful to describe a longer-term series as an Event.

ReportageNewsArticle

The <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/ReportageNewsArticle">ReportageNewsArticle</a> type is a subtype of <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/NewsArticle">NewsArticle</a> representing
 news articles which are the result of journalistic news reporting conventions.<br/><br/>

In practice many news publishers produce a wide variety of article types, many of which might be considered a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/NewsArticle">NewsArticle</a> but not a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/ReportageNewsArticle">ReportageNewsArticle</a>. For example, opinion pieces, reviews, analysis, sponsored or satirical articles, or articles that combine several of these elements.<br/><br/>

The <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/ReportageNewsArticle">ReportageNewsArticle</a> type is based on a stricter ideal for "news" as a work of journalism, with articles based on factual information either observed or verified by the author, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.  This often includes perspectives from multiple viewpoints on a particular issue (distinguishing news reports from public relations or propaganda).  News reports in the <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/ReportageNewsArticle">ReportageNewsArticle</a> sense de-emphasize the opinion of the author, with commentary and value judgements typically expressed elsewhere.<br/><br/>

A <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/ReportageNewsArticle">ReportageNewsArticle</a> which goes deeper into analysis can also be marked with an additional type of <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/AnalysisNewsArticle">AnalysisNewsArticle</a>.

SpecialAnnouncement
A SpecialAnnouncement combines a simple date-stamped textual information update
      with contextualized Web links and other structured data.  It represents an information update made by a
      locally-oriented organization, for example schools, pharmacies, healthcare providers,  community groups, police,
      local government.<br/><br/>

For work in progress guidelines on Coronavirus-related markup see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ikaGCKxo50rRM7nvKSlbUpjyIk2WMQd3IkB1lItlrM/edit#">this doc</a>.<br/><br/>

The motivating scenario for SpecialAnnouncement is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic">Coronavirus pandemic</a>, and the initial vocabulary is oriented to this urgent situation. Schema.org
expect to improve the markup iteratively as it is deployed and as feedback emerges from use. In addition to our
usual <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2490">Github entry</a>, feedback comments can also be provided in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fpdFFxk8s87CWwACs53SGkYv3aafSxz_DTtOQxMrBJQ/edit#">this document</a>.<br/><br/>

While this schema is designed to communicate urgent crisis-related information, it is not the same as an emergency warning technology like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol">CAP</a>, although there may be overlaps. The intent is to cover
the kinds of everyday practical information being posted to existing websites during an emergency situation.<br/><br/>

Several kinds of information can be provided:<br/><br/>

We encourage the provision of "name", "text", "datePosted", "expires" (if appropriate), "category" and
"url" as a simple baseline. It is important to provide a value for "category" where possible, most ideally as a well known
URL from Wikipedia or Wikidata. In the case of the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, this should be "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic" or "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81068910".<br/><br/>

For many of the possible properties, values can either be simple links or an inline description, depending on whether a summary is available. For a link, provide just the URL of the appropriate page as the property's value. For an inline description, use a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/WebContent">WebContent</a> type, and provide the url as a property of that, alongside at least a simple "<a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/text">text</a>" summary of the page. It is
unlikely that a single SpecialAnnouncement will need all of the possible properties simultaneously.<br/><br/>

We expect that in many cases the page referenced might contain more specialized structured data, e.g. contact info, <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/openingHours">openingHours</a>, <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Event">Event</a>, <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/FAQPage">FAQPage</a> etc. By linking to those pages from a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement">SpecialAnnouncement</a> you can help make it clearer that the events are related to the situation (e.g. Coronavirus) indicated by the <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/category">category</a> property of the <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement">SpecialAnnouncement</a>.<br/><br/>

Many <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement">SpecialAnnouncement</a>s will relate to particular regions and to identifiable local organizations. Use <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/spatialCoverage">spatialCoverage</a> for the region, and <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/announcementLocation">announcementLocation</a> to indicate specific <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/LocalBusiness">LocalBusiness</a>es and <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/CivicStructure">CivicStructure</a>s. If the announcement affects both a particular region and a specific location (for example, a library closure that serves an entire region), use both <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/spatialCoverage">spatialCoverage</a> and <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/announcementLocation">announcementLocation</a>.<br/><br/>

The <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/about">about</a> property can be used to indicate entities that are the focus of the announcement. We now recommend using <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/about">about</a> only
for representing non-location entities (e.g. a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Course">Course</a> or a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/RadioStation">RadioStation</a>). For places, use <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/announcementLocation">announcementLocation</a> and <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/spatialCoverage">spatialCoverage</a>. Consumers of this markup should be aware that the initial design encouraged the use of <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/about">about</a> for locations too.<br/><br/>

The basic content of <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement">SpecialAnnouncement</a> is similar to that of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)">Atom</a> feed. For publishers without such feeds, basic feed-like information can be shared by posting
<a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement">SpecialAnnouncement</a> updates in a page, e.g. using JSON-LD. For sites with Atom/RSS functionality, you can point to a feed
with the <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/webFeed">webFeed</a> property. This can be a simple URL, or an inline <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/DataFeed">DataFeed</a> object, with <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/encodingFormat">encodingFormat</a> providing
media type information, e.g. "application/rss+xml" or "application/atom+xml".

A StatisticalPopulation is a set of instances of a certain given type that satisfy some set of constraints. The property <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/populationType">populationType</a> is used to specify the type. Any property that can be used on instances of that type can appear on the statistical population. For example, a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/StatisticalPopulation">StatisticalPopulation</a> representing all <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Person">Person</a>s with a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/homeLocation">homeLocation</a> of East Podunk California would be described by applying the appropriate <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/homeLocation">homeLocation</a> and <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/populationType">populationType</a> properties to a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/StatisticalPopulation">StatisticalPopulation</a> item that stands for that set of people.
The properties <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/numConstraints">numConstraints</a> and <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/constraintProperty">constraintProperty</a> are used to specify which of the populations properties are used to specify the population. Note that the sense of "population" used here is the general sense of a statistical
population, and does not imply that the population consists of people. For example, a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/populationType">populationType</a> of <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Event">Event</a> or <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/NewsArticle">NewsArticle</a> could be used. See also <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Observation">Observation</a>, where a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/populationType">populationType</a> such as <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Person">Person</a> or <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Event">Event</a> can be indicated directly. In most cases it may be better to use <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/StatisticalVariable">StatisticalVariable</a> instead of <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/StatisticalPopulation">StatisticalPopulation</a>.
StatisticalPopulation




<a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/StatisticalVariable">StatisticalVariable</a> represents any type of statistical metric that can be measured at a place and time. The usage pattern for <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/StatisticalVariable">StatisticalVariable</a> is typically expressed using <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Observation">Observation</a> with an explicit <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/populationType">populationType</a>, which is a type, typically drawn from Schema.org. Each <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/StatisticalVariable">StatisticalVariable</a> is marked as a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/ConstraintNode">ConstraintNode</a>, meaning that some properties (those listed using <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/constraintProperty">constraintProperty</a>) serve in this setting solely to define the statistical variable rather than literally describe a specific person, place or thing. For example, a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/StatisticalVariable">StatisticalVariable</a> Median<em>Height</em>Person_Female representing the median height of women, could be written as follows: the population type is <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Person">Person</a>; the measuredProperty <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/height">height</a>; the <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/statType">statType</a> <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/median">median</a>; the <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/gender">gender</a> <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Female">Female</a>. It is important to note that there are many kinds of scientific quantitative observation which are not fully, perfectly or unambiguously described following this pattern, or with solely Schema.org terminology. The approach taken here is designed to allow partial, incremental or minimal description of <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/StatisticalVariable">StatisticalVariable</a>s, and the use of detailed sets of entity and property IDs from external repositories. The <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/measurementMethod">measurementMethod</a>, <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/unitCode">unitCode</a> and <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/unitText">unitText</a> properties can also be used to clarify the specific nature and notation of an observed measurement.

Anatomical features that can be observed by sight (without dissection), including the form and proportions of the human body as well as surface landmarks that correspond to deeper subcutaneous structures. Superficial anatomy plays an important role in sports medicine, phlebotomy, and other medical specialties as underlying anatomical structures can be identified through surface palpation. For example, during back surgery, superficial anatomy can be used to palpate and count vertebrae to find the site of incision. Or in phlebotomy, superficial anatomy can be used to locate an underlying vein; for example, the median cubital vein can be located by palpating the borders of the cubital fossa (such as the epicondyles of the humerus) and then looking for the superficial signs of the vein, such as size, prominence, ability to refill after depression, and feel of surrounding tissue support. As another example, in a subluxation (dislocation) of the glenohumeral joint, the bony structure becomes pronounced with the deltoid muscle failing to cover the glenohumeral joint allowing the edges of the scapula to be superficially visible. Here, the superficial anatomy is the visible edges of the scapula, implying the underlying dislocation of the joint (the related anatomical structure).

      a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Schedule">Schedule</a> to be specified. If an exception is specified as a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/DateTime">DateTime</a> then only the event that would have started at that specific date and time
      should be excluded from the schedule. If an exception is specified as a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Date">Date</a> then any event that is scheduled for that 24 hour period should be
      excluded from the schedule. This allows a whole day to be excluded from the schedule without having to itemise every scheduled event.

gtin

A Global Trade Item Number (<a href="https://www.gs1.org/standards/id-keys/gtin">GTIN</a>). GTINs identify trade items, including products and services, using numeric identification codes.<br/><br/>

The GS1 <a href="https://www.gs1.org/standards/Digital-Link/">digital link specifications</a> express GTINs as URLs (URIs, IRIs, etc.). Details including regular expression examples can be found in, Section 6 of the GS1 URI Syntax specification; see also <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/3156#issuecomment-1209522809">schema.org tracking issue</a> for schema.org-specific discussion. A correct <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/gtin">gtin</a> value should be a valid GTIN, which means that it should be an all-numeric string of either 8, 12, 13 or 14 digits, or a "GS1 Digital Link" URL based on such a string. The numeric component should also have a <a href="https://www.gs1.org/services/check-digit-calculator">valid GS1 check digit</a> and meet the other rules for valid GTINs. See also <a href="http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin">GS1's GTIN Summary</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Trade_Item_Number">Wikipedia</a> for more details. Left-padding of the gtin values is not required or encouraged. The <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/gtin">gtin</a> property generalizes the earlier <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/gtin8">gtin8</a>, <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/gtin12">gtin12</a>, <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/gtin13">gtin13</a>, and <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/gtin14">gtin14</a> properties.<br/><br/>

Note also that this is a definition for how to include GTINs in Schema.org data, and not a definition of GTINs in general - see the GS1 documentation for authoritative details.

itemListElement
For itemListElement values, you can use simple strings (e.g. "Peter", "Paul", "Mary"), existing entities, or use ListItem.<br/><br/>

Text values are best if the elements in the list are plain strings. Existing entities are best for a simple, unordered list of existing things in your data. ListItem is used with ordered lists when you want to provide additional context about the element in that list or when the same item might be in different places in different lists.<br/><br/>

Note: The order of elements in your mark-up is not sufficient for indicating the order or elements.  Use ListItem with a 'position' property in such cases.

The measuredProperty of an <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Observation">Observation</a>, typically via its <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/StatisticalVariable">StatisticalVariable</a>. There are various kinds of applicable <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Property">Property</a>: a schema.org property, a property from other RDF-compatible systems, e.g. W3C RDF Data Cube, Data Commons, Wikidata, or schema.org extensions such as <a href="https://www.gs1.org/voc/?show=properties">GS1's</a>.

A subproperty of <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/measurementTechnique">measurementTechnique</a> that can be used for specifying specific methods, in particular via <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/MeasurementMethodEnum">MeasurementMethodEnum</a>.
measurementMethod


























Provides additional qualification to an observation. For example, a GDP observation measures the Nominal value.
measurementQualifier





















A technique, method or technology used in an <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Observation">Observation</a>, <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/StatisticalVariable">StatisticalVariable</a> or <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Dataset">Dataset</a> (or <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/DataDownload">DataDownload</a>, <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/DataCatalog">DataCatalog</a>), corresponding to the method used for measuring the corresponding variable(s) (for datasets, described using <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/variableMeasured">variableMeasured</a>; for <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Observation">Observation</a>, a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/StatisticalVariable">StatisticalVariable</a>). Often but not necessarily each <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/variableMeasured">variableMeasured</a> will have an explicit representation as (or mapping to) an property such as those defined in Schema.org, or other RDF vocabularies and "knowledge graphs". In that case the subproperty of <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/variableMeasured">variableMeasured</a> called <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/measuredProperty">measuredProperty</a> is applicable.<br/><br/>

The <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/measurementTechnique">measurementTechnique</a> property helps when extra clarification is needed about how a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/measuredProperty">measuredProperty</a> was measured. This is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but may have broader applicability; it is not intended as a full representation of measurement, but can often serve as a high level summary for dataset discovery. <br/><br/>

For example, if <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/variableMeasured">variableMeasured</a> is: molecule concentration, <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/measurementTechnique">measurementTechnique</a> could be: "mass spectrometry" or "nmr spectroscopy" or "colorimetry" or "immunofluorescence". If the <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/variableMeasured">variableMeasured</a> is "depression rating", the <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/measurementTechnique">measurementTechnique</a> could be "Zung Scale" or "HAM-D" or "Beck Depression Inventory". <br/><br/>

If there are several <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/variableMeasured">variableMeasured</a> properties recorded for some given data object, use a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/PropertyValue">PropertyValue</a> for each <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/variableMeasured">variableMeasured</a> and attach the corresponding <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/measurementTechnique">measurementTechnique</a>. The value can also be from an enumeration, organized as a <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/MeasurementMetholdEnumeration">MeasurementMetholdEnumeration</a>.

The <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/mobileUrl">mobileUrl</a> property is provided for specific situations in which data consumers need to determine whether one of several provided URLs is a dedicated 'mobile site'.<br/><br/>

To discourage over-use, and reflecting intial usecases, the property is expected only on <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Product">Product</a> and <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Offer">Offer</a>, rather than <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Thing">Thing</a>.

Pages and sites referenced with the long-established <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/url">url</a> property should ideally also be usable on a wide variety of devices, including mobile phones. In most cases, it would be pointless and counter productive to attempt to update all <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/url">url</a> markup to use <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/mobileUrl">mobileUrl</a> for more mobile-oriented pages. The property is intended for the case when items (primarily <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Product">Product</a> and <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/Offer">Offer</a>) have extra URLs hosted on an additional "mobile site" alongside the main one.

The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of
      contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates
      areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York.




















speakable
Indicates sections of a Web page that are particularly 'speakable' in the sense of being highlighted as being especially appropriate for text-to-speech conversion. Other sections of a page may also be usefully spoken in particular circumstances; the 'speakable' property serves to indicate the parts most likely to be generally useful for speech.<br/><br/>

The <em>speakable</em> property can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator' values:<br/><br/>

1.) <em>id-value</em> URL references - uses <em>id-value</em> of an element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of <em>speakable</em> has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned.<br/><br/>

2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, e.g. via class attribute. Use the <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/cssSelector">cssSelector</a> property.<br/><br/>

3.)  XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/xpath">xpath</a> property.<br/><br/>

For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this
we define a supporting type, <a class="localLink" href="https://schema.org/SpeakableSpecification">SpeakableSpecification</a>  which is defined to be a possible value of the <em>speakable</em> property.
