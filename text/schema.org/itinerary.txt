      <h2>
        Shakespeareâs Gatehouse
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Cockpit pub marks the approximate site of Shakespeareâs gatehouse. On 10 March 1613, Shakespeare bought the old priory gatehouse from Henry Walker, âcitizen and minstrel (musician)â for Â£140. It was later bought at an auction in 1843 by the City of London Corporation for Â£145. The deed of purchase for the property still exists today and is housed at the London Metropolitan Archives; it contains one of only six âauthenticatedâ examples of Shakespeareâs signature. The property is particularly significant because â although Shakespeare owned property in Stratford â it is the only property he is known to have owned in London. Given its convenient proximity to the Blackfriars Playhouse and The Globe, Shakespeare may have intended to make it his home, yet no evidence suggests he lived here in the four years prior to his death in 1616.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>
        Blackfriars Playhouse
      </h2>
      <p>
        Shakespeareâs Blackfriars Playhouse stood in Playhouse Yard and is regarded as one of the most important sites in English theatre history. Richard Burbage formed a syndicate with Shakespeare, Henry Condell and John Heminge, among others, and together they purchased the playhouse in 1608; yet, due to the outbreak of plague, the opening was delayed until the winter of 1609. It is widely believed that The Winterâs Tale and Cymbeline were written with the Blackfriars Playhouse in mind, despite the fact both plays were also performed at The Globe theatre. The final show at Blackfriars Playhouse was performed in 1642, before it was pulled down in 1655.
