Properties from 
    
    
    Thing

additionalType

Text  or 
URL
An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org style guide.

The industry associated with the job position.
  

isInvolvedInBiologicalProcess

BioChemEntity
Biological process this BioChemEntity is involved in; please use PropertyValue if you want to include any evidence.

jobTitle

Person
The job title of the person (for example, Financial Manager).
  

keywords

CreativeWork  or 
Event  or 
Organization  or

measurementMethod

DataCatalog  or 
DataDownload  or 
Dataset  or 
Observation  or 
PropertyValue  or 
StatisticalVariable
A subproperty of measurementTechnique that can be used for specifying specific methods, in particular via MeasurementMethodEnum.
  

measurementTechnique

DataCatalog  or 
DataDownload  or 
Dataset  or 
Observation  or 
PropertyValue  or 
StatisticalVariable
A technique, method or technology used in an Observation, StatisticalVariable or Dataset (or DataDownload, DataCatalog), corresponding to the method used for measuring the corresponding variable(s) (for datasets, described using variableMeasured; for Observation, a StatisticalVariable). Often but not necessarily each variableMeasured will have an explicit representation as (or mapping to) an property such as those defined in Schema.org, or other RDF vocabularies and "knowledge graphs". In that case the subproperty of variableMeasured called measuredProperty is applicable.

The measurementTechnique property helps when extra clarification is needed about how a measuredProperty was measured. This is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but may have broader applicability; it is not intended as a full representation of measurement, but can often serve as a high level summary for dataset discovery. 

For example, if variableMeasured is: molecule concentration, measurementTechnique could be: "mass spectrometry" or "nmr spectroscopy" or "colorimetry" or "immunofluorescence". If the variableMeasured is "depression rating", the measurementTechnique could be "Zung Scale" or "HAM-D" or "Beck Depression Inventory". 

If there are several variableMeasured properties recorded for some given data object, use a PropertyValue for each variableMeasured and attach the corresponding measurementTechnique. The value can also be from an enumeration, organized as a MeasurementMetholdEnumeration.
  

pattern

CreativeWork  or 
Product
A pattern that something has, for example 'polka dot', 'striped', 'Canadian flag'. Values are typically expressed as text, although links to controlled value schemes are also supported.
  

physicalRequirement

JobPosting
A description of the types of physical activity associated with the job. Defined terms such as those in O*net may be used, but note that there is no way to specify the level of ability as well as its nature when using a defined term.
  

potentialUse

ChemicalSubstance  or 
MolecularEntity
Intended use of the BioChemEntity by humans.
  

programType

EducationalOccupationalProgram
The type of educational or occupational program. For example, classroom, internship, alternance, etc.
  

sensoryRequirement

JobPosting
A description of any sensory requirements and levels necessary to function on the job, including hearing and vision. Defined terms such as those in O*net may be used, but note that there is no way to specify the level of ability as well as its nature when using a defined term.
  

size

CreativeWork  or 
Product
A standardized size of a product or creative work, specified either through a simple textual string (for example 'XL', '32Wx34L'), a  QuantitativeValue with a unitCode, or a comprehensive and structured SizeSpecification; in other cases, the width, height, depth and weight properties may be more applicable.
  

skills

JobPosting  or 
Occupation
A statement of knowledge, skill, ability, task or any other assertion expressing a competency that is desired or required to fulfill this role or to work in this occupation.
