A tourist destination. In principle any Place can be a TouristDestination from a City, Region or Country to an AmusementPark or Hotel. This Type can be used on its own to describe a general TouristDestination, or be used as an additionalType to add tourist relevant properties to any other Place.  A TouristDestination is defined as a Place that contains, or is colocated with, one or more TouristAttractions, often linked by a similar theme or interest to a particular touristType. The UNWTO defines Destination (main destination of a tourism trip) as the place visited that is central to the decision to take the trip.
  (See examples below.)

    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org style guide.

    Ribera del Duero Wine Route
  </h1>
  <div>
    <p>
      Ribera del Duero is on the northern plateau of Spain and covers parts of the provinces of Burgos, Segovia, Soria and Valladolid. The course of the River Duero marks the landscape here, dotting it with gentle hills, valleys and moorland, where vines are mixed with cereal crops.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wines from Ribera del Duero are the gateway to extensive and varied examples of its heritage; a sign of the cultural, historical and artistic wealth of the region.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ribera del Duero wine route offers visitors charming villages where they can find monuments, castles, towers, cloisters, squares with special columns, cloistered convents, monasteries, churches, museums and palaces. Buildings from the Romanesque, Gothic and medieval periods will fill visitorsâ memories with spectacular moments and unforgettable instants.

The course of the River Duero marks the landscape here, dotting it with gentle hills, valleys and moorland, where vines are mixed with cereal crops.
The wines from Ribera del Duero are the gateway to extensive and varied examples of its heritage; a sign of the cultural, historical and artistic wealth of the region.
The Ribera del Duero wine route offers visitors charming villages where they can find monuments, castles, towers, cloisters, squares with special columns, cloistered convents, monasteries, churches, museums and palaces.
