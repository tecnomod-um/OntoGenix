Issue #2892: Clarifications around Blog, BlogPosting and LiveBlogPosting, including better cross-referencing, and acknowledgment of related terminology ("weblog", and "blog" in the sense of posting).

Issue #2862: Additions proposed by the the Bioschemas community.


Adds several types for basic life science concepts. A type Taxon, with properties:
childTaxon
parentTaxon
taxonRank
hasDefinedTerm.

Issue #2907: Added directApply property to indicate on a JobPosting whether
  direct applications are supported.
Issue #2844: Additional detail for MediaReview description.


To cross-reference (via link or embedded description) between ClaimReview
and MediaReview, two new properties:
associatedClaimReview,
associatedMediaReview. These are defined as specializations of a
common superproperty: associatedReview.

To describe exact, specific, "frozen" snapshots of a potentially changing
MediaObject, three new types:
  ImageObjectSnapshot,
  AudioObjectSnapshot,
  VideoObjectSnapshot. A new property,
  sha256, can be used to identify the specific file by a
  hash of its contents.
  To group together multiple elements for reference by itemReviewed, a new
  type:  MediaReviewItem. Its property,
  mediaItemAppearance, can use the "snapshot" types to bundle
  several different appearances of the same basic media item.
  For the case of an image with embedded text, a new property:  embeddedTextCaption (a subproperty of   caption). To characterize the original context of a potentially decontextualized media item, a property   originalMediaContextDescription, alongside
  originalMediaLink,
  embeddedTextCaption,
  interpretedAsClaim,
  claimInterpreter, and
  archivedAt to provide additional supporting information useful for fact checking and
  misinformation-related workflows.

Issue #2912: Add a Statement type, parallel to Claim, for simple statements such as "fun or interesting" facts, to distinguish them from more formal (e.g. fact-checkable) claims.

concern for cleanup and integration of existing vocabulary. Notable additions include ExhibitionEvent,
Barcode, DataFeed, containsPlace, GeoCircle,
geoRadius, geoMidpoint, providerMobility
and actionPlatform. A number of changes improve our handling of Service description, including the
 deprecation of the ProfessionalService construct. We have kept all the specific types that were previously
 considered ProfessionalService but discourage the use of the type 'ProfessionalService' since it is easily confused with 'Service'.

Issue #113: Added GeoCircle as a subtype of GeoShape, providing
  a more usable mechanism than circle structured text; added geoRadius, geoMidpoint to describe the size and location of these circular areas.
Issue #323: Added locationCreated to CreativeWork.
Issue #811: Renamed containedIn as containedInPlace, and added an inverse containsPlace.
Issue #810: postalCode and addressCountry are now an expected property for GeoShape and GeoCoordinates.
Adjusted addressCountry to allow textual values, matching the existing definition.
Issue #801:
Broadened award, category, offers to be applicable on Service.
Extended itemOffered to expect Service as a possible value.
Added LegalService as a supertype for Notary, Attorney.

Marked ProfessionalService as deprecated, with some explanation, and added a brief account of
the relationship with Service to some of the more service-oriented local business types
e.g. LegalService, HomeAndConstructionBusiness.

A cluster of construction-related local businesses
formerly treated as ProfessionalService continue as HomeAndConstructionBusiness subtypes.

Marked Attorney as deprecated in favor of LegalService
per #784. Added hoursAvailable to Service.

Issue #411
    Clarification and cleanup around areaServed, now marked as a super-property of
    the more specific eligibleRegion and availableAtOrFrom properties.
    Cross-referenced eligibleRegion and ineligibleRegion.
    Marked serviceArea as supersededBy areaServed. Updated the associated
    types for areaServed to cover those used by its sub-properties.
  
Issue #808: The address property now anticipates Text values, to support unstructured address data.

2.1sdo-ganymede(2015-08-06)
Version 2.1 (working name 'sdo-ganymede') includes many small fixes, some new vocabulary, as well as the first release of the 'hosted extensions' mechanism, featuring bib(liographic) and auto(mobile) extensions for final review. A pre-release of this version of schema.org was available for review.

Vocabulary

Issue #611: Added Person as expected value for publisher property.
Issue #596: Documented that affiliation is a  sub-property of memberOf.
Issue #207: Added a Bridge type under CivicStructure.
Issue #346: Added URL as expected value for genre property.
Issue #374: Added Report type under Article, and a reportNumber property.
Issue #577: Amended videoFormat to indicate that it is expected on BroadcastEvent and ScreeningEvent, rather than TelevisionStation.
Issue #535: Broadened domain of parentOrganization to allow any Organization, rather than only LocalBusiness. Noted parentOrganization and subOrganization as inverses.
Issue #531: Added the lyrics property to MusicComposition.
Issue #518: Renamed paymentDue property to paymentDueDate. Changed paymentStatus property to expect an enumerated value of type PaymentStatusType in addition to Text. The options are: PaymentComplete, PaymentDue, PaymentPastDue, PaymentDeclined and PaymentAutomaticallyApplied.
Issue #137: Deprecated UserInteraction and its children in favor of a new type: InteractionCounter. InteractionCounter allows for reporting aggregated statistics by service and type. Thanks elf Pavlik for collaboration.

Issue #655: Extension definitions now include an isPartOf property to link them to the extension.
Issue #527: Added materials from Kickoff Workshop in 2011.
Issue #78: Multiple supertypes are now displayed properly. It is possible for several schema.org types to apply to a single thing, and for a type to have multiple parent types. This is relatively rare, but important to display. For example, anything that is a LocalBusiness is considered both an Organization and a Place; so all subtypes of LocalBusiness have both as supertypes. We can now show this more clearly, e.g. ElectronicsStore.
Added CSS for explicit styling () in releases page during Steering Group review of candidate releases.
Issue #557, #660, #695, #469: Several DataType-related navigation fixes, following recent modeling changes.

Issue #585: Fix description of netWorth, which erroneously included Organization.

Numerous small documentation fixes for typos, markup validity and textual clarity.
Fixes to several examples including byArtist, Place, Question/Answer, ...
Issue #552, #644: Fixes for Book examples.
Issue #382: Removed examples that don't reference WebPage from WebPage.
Issue #643: Moved bulk of mainEntityOfPage documentation into dedicated background notes.

2.0sdo-gozer(2015-05-12)
Version 2.0 consolidates and integrates schema.org's existing vocabulary. This version features many updated definitions, type/property associations and term names that
improve consistency and usability. It also introduces a new extension system.
Version 2.0 adds various new terms including mainEntityOfPage and major contributions from the
Automotive Ontology community.


Vocabulary


Issue #262: Added new vocabulary for Car:

The new vocabulary includes a number of properties such as: numberOfAirbags,
numberOfAxles,
numberOfForwardGears,
fuelConsumption,
fuelEfficiency
vehicleEngine,
EngineSpecification...

Thanks to Martin Hepp, Mirek Sopek, Karol SzczepaÅski and others
in the Automotive Ontology community group.
We anticipate substantial additions that build on this foundation will be contributed as an extension.


Issue #301: Added a generic property/values mechanism, building upon PropertyValueSpecification, StructuredValue and value; added
PropertyValue and additionalProperty. See examples for usage.  This is a lightweight
    mechanism to allow markup of properties that are not easily mapped to existing schema.org properties. Whenever possible, it is generally better to use a dedicated schema.org property if one exists.

Issue #301: Added mainEntityOfPage (and an inverse, mainEntity) to indicate which of the entities mentioned in a page is its primary topic.
Issue #225: Added a schemaVersion property, for use by applications that require more precise referencing of schema versions.
Issue #266: Added OrderItem to allow ParcelDelivery to be tracked per item, not just on an entire Order.

Issue #300: Answer is now a sub-type of Comment. The 'question' property expects 'Question' type for its values (rather than Text as in AskAction previously). Added resultComment on ReplyAction. Cleaned up examples.
Issue #130: Amended True and False to be instances (rather than sub-types) of Boolean.
Issue #218: Amended DataType to model it as a sub-class of Class, with each datatype e.g. Boolean, Text, Date, DateTime, Time etc. being classes that have a typeOf DataType. DataTypes can have sub-types, e.g. Integer and Float are subtypes of Number.
Issue #328: Added ScreeningEvent to support movie/video screenings.
Issue #314: Added MovieClip and  VideoGameClip as parallels to  TVClip and  RadioClip.
Issue #122: Added gtin12 property for Product.
Issue #417: Renamed many types and properties, which had overly generic names. This is no cause for alarm,
the superseded names can still be used, although we encourage consumers and producers of schema.org data to move towards the newer terminology.
    CreativeWorkSeason was Season,
    CreativeWorkSeries was Series,
    SoftwareSourceCode was Code,
    TaxiService was Taxi,
    actionApplication was application,
    actionOption was option,
    artMedium was material,
    artworkSurface was surface,

    codeSampleType was sampleType,
    containsSeason was season,
    datasetTimeInterval was temporal,
    executableLibraryName was assembly,
    exerciseCourse was course,

    isAccessibleForFree was free,
    jobBenefits was benefits,
    runtimePlatform was runtime,
    serviceArea was area,
    serviceOutput was produces,
    softwareRequirements was requirements,
    targetCollection was collection.


Site improvements

Issue #429: Implementation of new extension system.
Issue #6: Improved 404 handler for missing pages, with support for old-style "/Person/Minister" extension URLs and Action-related "/query-input" pseudo-properties.
Issue #318: Added an experimental JSON(-LD) view of the hierarchy. This combines D3 with RDF schema. Thanks to Gregg Kellogg and Sandro Hawke for collaboration.
Various behind-the-scenes improvement to the site software.

Quick fixes and Examples

Issue #119: Added a link to GS1's page giving background information on /globalLocationNumber.
Issue #471: Added a JSON example for exampleOfWork and workExample.
Issue #131: Amended category to be applicable to Product
Issue #8: Fixed description of box to follow the original rNews definition (instead of accidental copy of polygon). Added explanatory text to GeoShape regarding commas/whitespace.
Issue #224: Changed expected value of openingHours to be Text rather than Duration, since latter is for ISO formats not our custom micro-syntax.
Issue #112: Clarified that upvoteCount and downvoteCount apply to questions, answers and comments (rather than just to questions).
Issue #103: Clarified description of StructuredValue.
Issue #333: Clarified description of BreadcrumbList.

Issue #315: Updated BroadcastService, marking it as a kind of Service rather than just Thing.
Issue #426: Broadened supersededBy to be usable with classes and enumerations.
Issue #366: Reworded description of publication to use 'item' instead of a list of types (which had omitted Book), and marked it as applicable to CreativeWork.
Issue #288: added properties related to boarding passes to FlightReservation.

Issue #335: added gameLocation to VideoGameSeries.

     raised around the need to describe series of games.
As a result we have made some changes to the Series type, which previously emphasised only
TV and Radio Series: added VideoGameSeries,
BookSeries, and MovieSeries. The recently added
Periodical type is also now modeled as a Series subtype. Some redundant
type/property associations were also tidied up. The existing
trailer property can now be used with
VideoGame and VideoGameSeries.

Added ControlAction (previously proposed as OperateAction). Add expectsAcceptanceOf
 on ConsumeAction (previously proposed as 'contingentOnOffer'). Added ineligibleRegion
 (on Offer, previously proposed as 'notAvailableAtOrFrom').

Add rsvpResponse, additionalNumberOfGuests properties
to the existing RsvpAction type
(see also github issue and details).
This change also adds an enumeration RsvpResponseType: RsvpResponseYes, RsvpResponseNo,
RsvpResponseMaybe. Finally, we add a new possible ActionStatusType: FailedActionStatus,
alongside an error property linking an Action to more information on the cause of the failure.

Add roleName to Role, superseding namedPosition (see also issue and details).
Add to MusicAlbum properties: albumProductionType,
albumReleaseType, albumRelease (and inverse, releaseOf).
Supporting enumerated types: MusicAlbumProductionType (CompilationAlbum, DemoAlbum,
DJMixAlbum, LiveAlbum, MixtapeAlbum, RemixAlbum,
SoundtrackAlbum, SpokenWordAlbum, StudioAlbum.
MusicAlbumReleaseType (AlbumRelease, BroadcastRelease, EPRelease,
SingleRelease).
Add new types: MusicRelease, MusicComposition, the latter with properties musicArrangement,
composer, firstPerformance, includedComposition, iswcCode,
lyricist, musicCompositionForm, musicalKey, recordedAs (inverse: recordingOf).
Expand track to allow ItemList values, for lists of MusicRecording, and
genre to apply to MusicGroup.

Broadened the description of logo property, to match the types it applies to. See also github issue and details.
Added a DatedMoneySpecification type for non-price monetary values, by analogy with PriceSpecification and its subtypes. Added amount and
currency properties and tweaked startDate and endDate property definitions to fit.

Site improvements

Added links to supporting blog posts for Role, Action and Periodical.
Added "alt" attributes to all image examples.
Fixed the Full Hierarchy page.

Quick fixes and Examples

Several minor bugfixes.

See also issue list for this release.



1.91(2014-09-12)
Offer/price documentation fixes, cleanup and community contributions.


Updated text of the price property to include practical usage guidance, alongside
links to information from GS1 to the gtin-related Offer properties.
Updated all our examples to follow that guidance; primarily by using priceCurrency and the content= attribute.
Noted our thanks to the OpenDomain project for our domain name.
Updated the text of the 'image' property to match its expected types. Thanks, Dan Scott.
Changed spelling of 'supercededBy' to the more conventional supersededBy. Thanks, Sachini Aparna Herath.
Noted that 'logo' and 'photo' are sub-properties of 'image'. Thanks, Sachini Aparna Herath, again.
Fixed two syntax errors in examples (Store opening hours RDFa; Book, PublicationVolume Microdata). Thanks, Gregg Kellogg.
Added Tolkien-based examples for exampleOfWork/workExample. Thanks, Dan Scott, again.
Fixed a bug with our UTF-8 support. Thanks, Richard Wallis.




1.9(2014-08-18)
Bibliographic improvements (Periodical and more) alongside seller/broker/provider clarifications.


Several bibliographic improvements, thanks to the work of the W3C BibExtend Community Group.
Improved handling of Periodicals, Articles and Multi-volume Works,
introducing types and supporting properties for Periodical,
PublicationVolume and
PublicationIssue. Adds new Article properties:
pageStart, pageEnd and pagination.
CreativeWork  gains a convenience inverse of isPartOf called
hasPart, as well as a new pair of inverses, workExample and
exampleOfWork that link specific and general perspectives on creative works. Many thanks to
all the BibExtend group members, to Richard Wallis
for chairing, and to Dan Scott for implementing.

Provider/Seller vocabulary: this update also clarifies how to use a set of related terms, integrating sections of schema.org that had developed
separately. Full details are documented at W3C
and in Github, alongside an overview document.
The provider property describes a service provider, service operator, or service performer, while
seller describe the entities which sell or offer a service on behalf of an actual service provider. We
introduce a more general broker property (replacing the over-specific bookingAgent),
as well as deprecating vendor and merchant in favour of seller.
Regarding flights and parcel delivery, carrier is
superseded by provider. Please also note that flightNumber should now be written in full (i.e. "UA110" rather than just "110").
See the supporting documents for details.

Finally, episodeNumber, seasonNumber and
clipNumber (for TV/Radio) have been harmonized with the periodicals design
(issueNumber and volumeNumber). In each case, both Integer
and Text values are anticipated. A common superproperty, position can also be used. This
reflects implementation experience and
establishes a model that can be applied elsewhere, e.g. ongoing work on describing music.
This update also improves the display and navigation of supersededBy relations between
schema.org properties (e.g. see seller).
The Terms of service document was also updated to note
that Yandex is now a schema.org Sponsor and to adopt the patent terms used by W3C.

(announcement)



1.8(2014-07-28)
Added WebSite type; broadened isPartOf property.

Added a new CreativeWork type, WebSite: "A WebSite is a set of related web pages and other items typically
served from a single web domain and accessible via URLs."  Also adopts the suggestion made by the BibExtend group and other
collaborators, to broaden the isPartOf property, which now relates any CreativeWork to any other CreativeWork.
This release also makes the Potential Actions documentation available in HTML.
Several markup fixes from StÃ©phane Corlosquet, alongside
improvements to the consistency of encoding /
associatedMedia property  definitions thanks to Dan Scott.
(announcement)



1.7(2014-07-08)
Allows image with ImageObject; adds Event organizers,
    Map improvements.
This release amends the image property, noting that ImageObject is a
    reasonable value. It also adds an organizer property to
    Event. Changes around Map: we add and prefer a 'hasMap' property
which supersedes the older 'map' property, and we add a mapType property which comes with some enumerated values:
ParkingMap, SeatingMap, TransitMap,
VenueMap. A Map might be (but needn't be) also an ImageObject.
    (announcement)


1.6(2014-06-16)
Roles, various fixes, site navigation improvements.
This release introduced the notion of a Role type to schema.org. See the blog post
    for details. The Role mechanism applies across all of schema.org, and allows simple statements to be elaborated or
    qualified, for example with temporal information. Other changes in this release include the addition of a
    license property, and some documentation of properties used internally by schema.org's documentation system
    (Property, Class, supersededBy, inverseOf).
    Fixed an embarrassing typo - "dead" -  in the diet property - thanks, Dan Scott. Various other
    small changes - listed in the preview announcement.
(announcement and
candidate release)


1.5 (2014-05-27)
Tweaks and fixes.
Tweaks to definition of 'keywords' to indicate that comma-separated entries are expected.
Several typo fixes from StÃ©phane Corlosquet. Adds a new icaoCode
text-valued property for Airport.
Updated description for flightNumber to note "not including the airline IATA code".
Added missing Actions-related definitions (urlTemplate, valueName).
    (announcement)



1.4(2014-05-16)
Examples, examples, examples.

    Added two examples to accompany workPerformed. Added several local business, company contact and music event examples.
Several glitch and typo fixes including MedicalEnumeration, thanks to Dan Scott.
announcement blog post



1.3(2014-05-01)
Added workPerformed.

Added workPerformed, a relationship between an Event and a CreativeWork
that is performed at the event.



1.2(2014-04-16)
Potential Actions.

Introduces vocabulary that enables websites to describe the actions they enable and how these actions can be invoked.
(announcement and
blog post)
    


1.1(2014-05-04)
Reservations, Q/A and more.

Added a Reservation schema. Question/Answer sites. Order changes. Added EmailMessage.

1.) This release of schema.org adds a finalized Reservations schema, which refines
earlier proposals discussed in the Web Schemas community over the last year.
See wiki for details.
The Reservations vocabulary includes: Reservation, ReservationPackage,
    ReservationStatusType,
Ticket, Flight,
EventReservation,
FlightReservation,
TrainReservation,
BusReservation,
TaxiReservation,
LodgingReservation,
RentalCarReservation,
ProgramMembership,
Seat,
Vehicle,
Airline,
FoodEstablishmentReservation,
TrainTrip,
Car,
BusTrip,
Taxi.
2.) Q/A sites
A simple vocabulary for Question/Answer and FAQ sites. It adds types for Question, Answer, and QAPage.
3.) Adds a type EmailMessage, analogous to the existing WebPage type.

(candidate release drafted as '1.0g'; not
formally announced but included in the change
to github-based publishing)



1.0f(2014-02-05)
Not-for-profit Offer and other fixes.
This version adapts the wording around the Offer type to suit non-profit scenarios,
    such as libraries. Thanks to Dan Scott and the BibExtend group for these proposals.
    This change broadens the definition of Offer and makes associated changes to
    ItemAvailability and
    OfferItemCondition, typically rewording "the item for sale" to
    simply say "the item". The itemOffered property is now defined more
    appropriately as "The item being offered." rather than "...sold.". The "seller"
    property is now defined as "The organization or person making the offer.", a compromise to support
    its use for more kinds of offer.
    (candidate release
    and announcement)




1.0e(2013-12-04)
Accessibility properties and Order type.

This release includes a schema for describing Orders,
as well as the Accessibility properties for
CreativeWork

(announcement)



0.99(2012-11-08)
Added Good Relations e-commerce vocabulary.
Added substantial e-commerce vocabulary based on Good Relations;
re-engineered site to accept RDFa/RDFS schema definitions from community.(wiki)
(announcement blog post
and email from Martin Hepp)



0.98(2012-10-18)
Fix for requiresSubscription property.

A minor bugfix release, which improved the documentation of requiresSubscription property.
We now encourage its Boolean value to be represented as true/false rather than yes/no.



0.97(2012-07-26)
Added DateTime, Time datatypes.
Added two datatypes in preparation for Good Relations integration.
(announcement)



0.96(2012-07-18)
Added additionalType property.
Added additionalType property (wiki).
"An additional type for the
item, typically used for adding more specific types from external
vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between
something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is
better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for
multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of
extra types, in particular those defined externally."
(announcement)



0.95(2012-06-26)
Added Medical/Health vocabulary.


This release added substantial vocabulary in the medical/health domain (around 100 classes, 200 properties). The additions are
mainly organized beneath the MedicalEntity type. An
overview document is also provided. From the blog post:

"This collaborative project drew upon search expertise from the schema.org partners but also gained immeasurably through feedback from expert reviewers including the US NCBI; physicians at Harvard, Duke and other institutions, as well as from several health Web sites. Contributions from the W3C Healthcare and Lifesciences group and Web Schemas community also helped bridge the complex worlds of Web standards, search and medicine/healthcare."

(announcement)



0.91(2012-04-21)
Removed plural 's' suffix from repeatable properties; added Comment type, SoftwareApplication vocabulary.


Added new properties per Singularity proposal:
23 changes: actor, album, attendee, award, blogPost, colleague, contactPoint, employee, encoding, episode, event, founder, map, member, parent, performer, photo, review, season, sibling, significantLink, subEvent, track.
Each of these originally had a plural 's' to indicate repeatability. After discussion in the W3C WebSchemas group, the consensus was that
this was confusing and worthwhile changing.


This revision added a new type, 'Comment', whose super-type is CreativeWork
(wiki)


Also adds SoftwareApplication and supporting vocabulary (wiki, original proposal),
including MobileApplication, WebApplication subtypes.


Converged URL/Url spelling. After WebSchemas discussion, consensus was:
For each of embedURL, contentURL, downloadURL, ensure there is an equivalent property named with mixed-case: 'embedUrl', 'contentUrl', 'downloadUrl'.





Note: this table is not currently complete - it misses 0.92-0.94 and any changes between 2011-06-02 and 2012-04-21(0.91). See also Linked Open Vocabularies entry.
