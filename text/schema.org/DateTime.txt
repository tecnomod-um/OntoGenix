Note that Event uses startDate/endDate instead of startTime/endTime, even when describing dates with times. This situation may be clarified in future revisions.
  

exceptDate

Schedule
Defines a Date or DateTime during which a scheduled Event will not take place. The property allows exceptions to
      a Schedule to be specified. If an exception is specified as a DateTime then only the event that would have started at that specific date and time
      should be excluded from the schedule. If an exception is specified as a Date then any event that is scheduled for that 24 hour period should be
      excluded from the schedule. This allows a whole day to be excluded from the schedule without having to itemise every scheduled event.

temporal

CreativeWork
The "temporal" property can be used in cases where more specific properties
(e.g. temporalCoverage, dateCreated, dateModified, datePublished) are not known to be appropriate.
  

temporalCoverage

CreativeWork
The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format. In
      the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written "2011/2012"). Other forms of content, e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode, may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL.
      Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via "1939/1945".

Open-ended date ranges can be written with ".." in place of the end date. For example, "2015-11/.." indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated.
