Schema.org COVID-19: US CDC Data Table fields

Editor: Dan Brickley <danbri@google.com>
Last Updated:2020-04-02

This document specifies a Schema.org representation of the following US CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) data format definition:

Title: Importing COVID-19 Patient Module Denominator data for Patient Safety Component (PSC)
URL:
  https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/covid19/import-covid19-data-508.pdf


The representation defined here is intended to be 1:1 with the original representation and round-trippable. The CDC document
defines several data fields in a tabular format. These are represented in Schema.org as properties of an object of type CDCPMDRecord.

  For all formal matters of interpretation for the properties listed in the table below, please refer to the source CDC documentation for authoritative definitions and official updates. This document (and accompanying schemas) may be updated in the future to track changes from CDC, but we cannot guarantee to do this immediately. Implementors are cautioned to check the CDC site for updates and clarifications. We expect that some aspects of the CDC definitions may change.


 The purpose of this schema definition is to provide a standards-based representation that can be used to encode and
 exchange records that correspond to the CDC format. Depending on context, any of the formats and standards that work
 with Schema.org may be applicable, including the Microdata, RDFa and JSON-LD data formats, as well as related technologies such as W3C SPARQL for data query. JSON-LD is in most cases likely to be the most appropriate format. There is no assumption that data encoded
 using this schema should necessarily be published on the public Web, nor that it would be used by search engines.

Schema.org vocabulary:
The following additions were made to Schema.org (in the Pending area, pending review and implementation feedback):

1 new type: Thing > Intangible > StructuredValue > CDCPMDRecord
14 new properties: cvdCollectionDate, cvdNumBeds, cvdNumTotBeds, cvdNumBedsOcc, cvdNumICUBeds, cvdNumICUBedsOcc, cvdNumVent, cvdNumVentUse, cvdNumC19HospPats, cvdNumC19MechVentPats, cvdNumC19HOPats, cvdNumC19OverflowPats, cvdNumC19OFMechVentPats, cvdNumC19Died.
In addition, a new healthcareReportingData property can be used to relate a Hospital to a CDCPMDRecord.
The datePosted property can also be used on a CDCPMDRecord.
Use cvdFacilityId to identify the NHSN facility, and (optionally)cvdFacilityCounty for its county name.

New properties: this adds several new properties (see "Schema.org name" column). Most are Number (with additional application-level constraints summarized in "Notes" column).  
The reason for prefixing each name  with cvd is to avoid clashing with similar or identical names already in use at Schema.org. For example, https://schema.org/numberOfBeds already exists for describing hotel rooms, apartments etc.; for the COVID-19 case it is simplest to keep things relatively self-contained.
