Properties from 
    
    
    QuantitativeValue

additionalProperty

PropertyValue
A property-value pair representing an additional characteristic of the entity, e.g. a product feature or another characteristic for which there is no matching property in schema.org.

Note: Publishers should be aware that applications designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. https://schema.org/width, https://schema.org/color, https://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically expect such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic property/value mechanism.
                
                
                
            


maxValue

Number
The upper value of some characteristic or property.
                
                
                
            


minValue

Number
The lower value of some characteristic or property.
                
                
                
            


unitCode

Text  or 
URL
The unit of measurement given using the UN/CEFACT Common Code (3 characters) or a URL. Other codes than the UN/CEFACT Common Code may be used with a prefix followed by a colon.
                
                
                
            


unitText

Text
A string or text indicating the unit of measurement. Useful if you cannot provide a standard unit code for
unitCode.
                
                
                
            


value

Boolean  or 
Number  or 
StructuredValue  or 
Text
The value of a QuantitativeValue (including Observation) or property value node.

For QuantitativeValue and MonetaryAmount, the recommended type for values is 'Number'.
For PropertyValue, it can be 'Text', 'Number', 'Boolean', or 'StructuredValue'.
Use values from 0123456789 (Unicode 'DIGIT ZERO' (U+0030) to 'DIGIT NINE' (U+0039)) rather than superficially similar Unicode symbols.
Use '.' (Unicode 'FULL STOP' (U+002E)) rather than ',' to indicate a decimal point. Avoid using these symbols as a readability separator.

Properties from 
    
    
    Thing

additionalType

Text  or 
URL
An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org style guide.
