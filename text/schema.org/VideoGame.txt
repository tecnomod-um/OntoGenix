editEIDR

Text  or 
URL
An EIDR (Entertainment Identifier Registry) identifier representing a specific edit / edition for a work of film or television.

For example, the motion picture known as "Ghostbusters" whose titleEIDR is "10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J" has several edits, e.g. "10.5240/1F2A-E1C5-680A-14C6-E76B-I" and "10.5240/8A35-3BEE-6497-5D12-9E4F-3".

Since schema.org types like Movie and TVEpisode can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use titleEIDR alone (for a general description), or alongside editEIDR for a more edit-specific description.

maintainer

Organization  or 
Person
A maintainer of a Dataset, software package (SoftwareApplication), or other Project. A maintainer is a Person or Organization that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on "upstream" sources. When maintainer is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a Dataset, it is always  possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The isBasedOn property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work.

Use businessFunction to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a Demand. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer.

CreativeWork  or 
URL
The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via URL) a document describing the editorial principles of an Organization (or individual, e.g. a Person writing a blog) that relate to their activities as a publisher, e.g. ethics or diversity policies. When applied to a CreativeWork (e.g. NewsArticle) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the CreativeWork.

While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a funder) can be expressed using schema.org terminology.

schemaVersion

Text  or 
URL
Indicates (by URL or string) a particular version of a schema used in some CreativeWork. This property was created primarily to
    indicate the use of a specific schema.org release, e.g. 10.0 as a simple string, or more explicitly via URL, https://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v10.0. There may be situations in which other schemas might usefully be referenced this way, e.g. http://dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dces/1999-07-02/ but this has not been carefully explored in the community.

sdPublisher

Organization  or 
Person
Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived automatically from existing published content but published on a different site. For example, student projects and open data initiatives often re-publish existing content with more explicitly structured metadata. The
sdPublisher property helps make such practices more explicit.

spatialCoverage

Place
The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of
      contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates
      areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York.

temporalCoverage

DateTime  or 
Text  or 
URL
The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format. In
      the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written "2011/2012"). Other forms of content, e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode, may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL.
      Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via "1939/1945".

Open-ended date ranges can be written with ".." in place of the end date. For example, "2015-11/.." indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated.
