Check for open issues.




Natural languages such as Spanish, Tamil, Hindi, English, etc. Formal language code tags expressed in BCP 47 can be used via the alternateName property. The Language type previously also covered programming languages such as Scheme and Lisp, which are now best represented using ComputerLanguage.
 





PropertyExpected TypeDescription




Properties from 
    
    
    Thing

additionalType

Text  or 
URL
An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org style guide.

disambiguatingDescription

Text
A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items.

PropertyValue  or 
Text  or

The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links.
