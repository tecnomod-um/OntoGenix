Check for open issues.




Provides negative considerations regarding something, most typically in pro/con lists for reviews (alongside positiveNotes). For symmetry 

In the case of a Review, the property describes the itemReviewed from the perspective of the review; in the case of a Product, the product itself is being described. Since product descriptions 
tend to emphasise positive claims, it may be relatively unusual to find negativeNotes used in this way. Nevertheless for the sake of symmetry, negativeNotes can be used on Product.

The property values can be expressed either as unstructured text (repeated as necessary), or if ordered, as a list (in which case the most negative is at the beginning of the list).
