SizeSpecification
A Schema.org Enumeration Type


This term is in the "new" area - implementation feedback and adoption from applications and websites can help improve our definitions.

Size related properties of a product, typically a size code (name) and optionally a sizeSystem, sizeGroup, and product measurements (hasMeasurement). In addition, the intended audience can be defined through suggestedAge, suggestedGender, and suggested body measurements (suggestedMeasurement).
 





PropertyExpected TypeDescription


Properties from 
    
    
    SizeSpecification

hasMeasurement

QuantitativeValue
A product measurement, for example the inseam of pants, the wheel size of a bicycle, or the gauge of a screw. Usually an exact measurement, but can also be a range of measurements for adjustable products, for example belts and ski bindings.
                
                
                
            


sizeGroup

SizeGroupEnumeration  or 
Text
The size group (also known as "size type") for a product's size. Size groups are common in the fashion industry to define size segments and suggested audiences for wearable products. Multiple values can be combined, for example "men's big and tall", "petite maternity" or "regular".
                
                
                
            


sizeSystem

SizeSystemEnumeration  or 
Text
The size system used to identify a product's size. Typically either a standard (for example, "GS1" or "ISO-EN13402"), country code (for example "US" or "JP"), or a measuring system (for example "Metric" or "Imperial").
                
                
                
            


suggestedAge

QuantitativeValue
The age or age range for the intended audience or person, for example 3-12 months for infants, 1-5 years for toddlers.
                
                
                
            


suggestedGender

GenderType  or 
Text
The suggested gender of the intended person or audience, for example "male", "female", or "unisex".
                
                
                
            


suggestedMeasurement

QuantitativeValue
A suggested range of body measurements for the intended audience or person, for example inseam between 32 and 34 inches or height between 170 and 190 cm. Typically found on a size chart for wearable products.
                
                
                
            


Properties from 
    
    
    QualitativeValue

additionalProperty

PropertyValue
A property-value pair representing an additional characteristic of the entity, e.g. a product feature or another characteristic for which there is no matching property in schema.org.

Note: Publishers should be aware that applications designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. https://schema.org/width, https://schema.org/color, https://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically expect such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic property/value mechanism.
                
                
                
            


equal

QualitativeValue
This ordering relation for qualitative values indicates that the subject is equal to the object.
                
                
                
            


greater

QualitativeValue
This ordering relation for qualitative values indicates that the subject is greater than the object.
                
                
                
            


greaterOrEqual

QualitativeValue
This ordering relation for qualitative values indicates that the subject is greater than or equal to the object.
                
                
                
            


lesser

QualitativeValue
This ordering relation for qualitative values indicates that the subject is lesser than the object.
                
                
                
            


lesserOrEqual

QualitativeValue
This ordering relation for qualitative values indicates that the subject is lesser than or equal to the object.
                
                
                
            


nonEqual

QualitativeValue
This ordering relation for qualitative values indicates that the subject is not equal to the object.

Properties from 
    
    
    Enumeration

supersededBy

Class  or 
Enumeration  or 
Property
Relates a term (i.e. a property, class or enumeration) to one that supersedes it.
                
                
                
            



Properties from 
    
    
    Thing

additionalType

Text  or 
URL
An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org style guide.
                
                
                
            


alternateName

Text

description

Text  or 
TextObject
A description of the item.
                
                
                
            


disambiguatingDescription

Text
A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation.
                
                
                
            


identifier

PropertyValue  or 
Text  or 
URL
The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See background notes for more details.

potentialAction

Action
Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role.
                
                
                
            


sameAs

URL
URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website.

size

CreativeWork  or 
Product
A standardized size of a product or creative work, specified either through a simple textual string (for example 'XL', '32Wx34L'), a  QuantitativeValue with a unitCode, or a comprehensive and structured SizeSpecification; in other cases, the width, height, depth and weight properties may be more applicable.
