Check for open issues.




A FloorPlan is an explicit representation of a collection of similar accommodations, allowing the provision of common information (room counts, sizes, layout diagrams) and offers for rental or sale. In typical use, some ApartmentComplex has an accommodationFloorPlan which is a FloorPlan.  A FloorPlan is always in the context of a particular place, either a larger ApartmentComplex or a single Apartment. The visual/spatial aspects of a floor plan (i.e. room layout, see wikipedia) can be indicated using image.

Text  or 
URL
An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org style guide.
