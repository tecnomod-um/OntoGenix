eventSchedule

Schedule
Associates an Event with a Schedule. There are circumstances where it is preferable to share a schedule for a series of
      repeating events rather than data on the individual events themselves. For example, a website or application might prefer to publish a schedule for a weekly
      gym class rather than provide data on every event. A schedule could be processed by applications to add forthcoming events to a calendar. An Event that
      is associated with a Schedule using this property should not have startDate or endDate properties. These are instead defined within the associated
      Schedule, this avoids any ambiguity for clients using the data. The property might have repeated values to specify different schedules, e.g. for different months
      or seasons.

additionalType

Text  or

An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org style guide.
