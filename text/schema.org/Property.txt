Properties from 
    
    
    Property

domainIncludes

Class
Relates a property to a class that is (one of) the type(s) the property is expected to be used on.
                
                
                
            


inverseOf

Property
Relates a property to a property that is its inverse. Inverse properties relate the same pairs of items to each other, but in reversed direction. For example, the 'alumni' and 'alumniOf' properties are inverseOf each other. Some properties don't have explicit inverses; in these situations RDFa and JSON-LD syntax for reverse properties can be used.
                
                
                
            


rangeIncludes

Class
Relates a property to a class that constitutes (one of) the expected type(s) for values of the property.
                
                
                
            


supersededBy

Class  or 
Enumeration  or 
Property
Relates a term (i.e. a property, class or enumeration) to one that supersedes it.
                
                
                
            



Properties from 
    
    
    Thing

additionalType

Text  or 
URL
An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org style guide.
                
                
                
            


alternateName

Text
An alias for the item.
                
                
                
            


description

Text  or 
TextObject
A description of the item.
                
                
                
            


disambiguatingDescription

Text
A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation.
                
                
                
            


identifier

PropertyValue  or 
Text  or 
URL
The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See background notes for more details.
                
                
                
            


image

ImageObject  or 
URL
An image of the item. This can be a URL or a fully described ImageObject.
                
                
                
            


mainEntityOfPage

CreativeWork  or 
URL
Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See background notes for details.

potentialAction

Action
Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role.
                
                
                
            


sameAs

URL
URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website.

CreativeWork  or 
Event
A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing.

Instances of 
    
    
    Property  may appear as a value for the following properties

PropertyOn TypesDescription

constraintProperty

ConstraintNode
Indicates a property used as a constraint. For example, in the definition of a StatisticalVariable. The value is a property, either from within Schema.org or from other compatible (e.g. RDF) systems such as DataCommons.org or Wikidata.org.
  

inverseOf

Property
Relates a property to a property that is its inverse. Inverse properties relate the same pairs of items to each other, but in reversed direction. For example, the 'alumni' and 'alumniOf' properties are inverseOf each other. Some properties don't have explicit inverses; in these situations RDFa and JSON-LD syntax for reverse properties can be used.
  

measuredProperty

Observation  or 
StatisticalVariable
The measuredProperty of an Observation, typically via its StatisticalVariable. There are various kinds of applicable Property: a schema.org property, a property from other RDF-compatible systems, e.g. W3C RDF Data Cube, Data Commons, Wikidata, or schema.org extensions such as GS1's.
  

statType

StatisticalVariable
Indicates the kind of statistic represented by a StatisticalVariable, e.g. mean, count etc. The value of statType is a property, either from within Schema.org (e.g. count, median, marginOfError, maxValue, minValue) or from other compatible (e.g. RDF) systems such as DataCommons.org or Wikidata.org.
  

supersededBy

Class  or 
Enumeration  or 
Property
Relates a term (i.e. a property, class or enumeration) to one that supersedes it.
  

variableMeasured

Dataset  or 
Observation
The variableMeasured property can indicate (repeated as necessary) the  variables that are measured in some dataset, either described as text or as pairs of identifier and description using PropertyValue, or more explicitly as a StatisticalVariable.
