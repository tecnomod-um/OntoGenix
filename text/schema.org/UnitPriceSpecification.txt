Properties from 
    
    
    UnitPriceSpecification

billingDuration

Duration  or 
Number  or 
QuantitativeValue
Specifies for how long this price (or price component) will be billed. Can be used, for example, to model the contractual duration of a subscription or payment plan. Type can be either a Duration or a Number (in which case the unit of measurement, for example month, is specified by the unitCode property).
                
                
                
            


billingIncrement

Number
This property specifies the minimal quantity and rounding increment that will be the basis for the billing. The unit of measurement is specified by the unitCode property.
                
                
                
            


billingStart

Number
Specifies after how much time this price (or price component) becomes valid and billing starts. Can be used, for example, to model a price increase after the first year of a subscription. The unit of measurement is specified by the unitCode property.
                
                
                
            


priceComponentType

PriceComponentTypeEnumeration
Identifies a price component (for example, a line item on an invoice), part of the total price for an offer.
                
                
                
            


priceType

PriceTypeEnumeration  or 
Text
Defines the type of a price specified for an offered product, for example a list price, a (temporary) sale price or a manufacturer suggested retail price. If multiple prices are specified for an offer the priceType property can be used to identify the type of each such specified price. The value of priceType can be specified as a value from enumeration PriceTypeEnumeration or as a free form text string for price types that are not already predefined in PriceTypeEnumeration.
                
                
                
            


referenceQuantity

QuantitativeValue
The reference quantity for which a certain price applies, e.g. 1 EUR per 4 kWh of electricity. This property is a replacement for unitOfMeasurement for the advanced cases where the price does not relate to a standard unit.
                
                
                
            


unitCode

Text  or 
URL
The unit of measurement given using the UN/CEFACT Common Code (3 characters) or a URL. Other codes than the UN/CEFACT Common Code may be used with a prefix followed by a colon.
                
                
                
            


unitText

Text
A string or text indicating the unit of measurement. Useful if you cannot provide a standard unit code for
unitCode.
                
                
                
            


Properties from 
    
    
    PriceSpecification

eligibleQuantity

QuantitativeValue
The interval and unit of measurement of ordering quantities for which the offer or price specification is valid. This allows e.g. specifying that a certain freight charge is valid only for a certain quantity.
                
                
                
            


eligibleTransactionVolume

PriceSpecification
The transaction volume, in a monetary unit, for which the offer or price specification is valid, e.g. for indicating a minimal purchasing volume, to express free shipping above a certain order volume, or to limit the acceptance of credit cards to purchases to a certain minimal amount.
                
                
                
            


maxPrice

Number
The highest price if the price is a range.
                
                
                
            


minPrice

Number
The lowest price if the price is a range.
                
                
                
            


price

Number  or 
Text
The offer price of a product, or of a price component when attached to PriceSpecification and its subtypes.

Usage guidelines:

Use the priceCurrency property (with standard formats: ISO 4217 currency format, e.g. "USD"; Ticker symbol for cryptocurrencies, e.g. "BTC"; well known names for Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS) and other currency types, e.g. "Ithaca HOUR") instead of including ambiguous symbols such as '$' in the value.
Use '.' (Unicode 'FULL STOP' (U+002E)) rather than ',' to indicate a decimal point. Avoid using these symbols as a readability separator.
Note that both RDFa and Microdata syntax allow the use of a "content=" attribute for publishing simple machine-readable values alongside more human-friendly formatting.
Use values from 0123456789 (Unicode 'DIGIT ZERO' (U+0030) to 'DIGIT NINE' (U+0039)) rather than superficially similar Unicode symbols.




priceCurrency

Text
The currency of the price, or a price component when attached to PriceSpecification and its subtypes.

Use standard formats: ISO 4217 currency format, e.g. "USD"; Ticker symbol for cryptocurrencies, e.g. "BTC"; well known names for Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS) and other currency types, e.g. "Ithaca HOUR".
                
                
                
            


validFrom

Date  or 
DateTime
The date when the item becomes valid.
                
                
                
            


validThrough

Date  or 
DateTime
The date after when the item is not valid. For example the end of an offer, salary period, or a period of opening hours.
                
                
                
            


valueAddedTaxIncluded

Boolean
Specifies whether the applicable value-added tax (VAT) is included in the price specification or not.
                
                
                
            




Properties from 
    
    
    Thing

additionalType

Text  or 
URL
An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
    use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org style guide.

disambiguatingDescription

Text
A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation.

Text  or 
URL
The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links.
