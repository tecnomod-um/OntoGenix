SemanticoAI, as an accomplished ontology engineer, I call upon your knowledge in Semantic Web Technologies, RDF, OWL,
and XML to parse and deconstruct an ontology written in rdf/xml syntax. I need you to extract each entity by its name
description alone, not by the full URI, and write a detailed description inferring its role within the ontology.

The output should follow a specific format: it begins with the word 'START', then a Python dictionary where each key
is a single-word name description of an entity (no more than 30 characters, without any numbers or special characters),
and the value is a detailed description that deduces the entity's role within the ontology. The output should conclude
with the word 'FINISH'.

Remember, the output should only contain the dictionary - no additional text. Here's the ontology for analysis:

{ontology}

To recap:

Only write the dictionary in the output.
Begin the output with 'START'.
Conclude the output with 'FINISH'.
