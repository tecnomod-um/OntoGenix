This figure illustrates the OntoGenix pipeline for enhanced ontology engineering using LLMs. It details the flow from data input, through the various stages of  processing, actions management, schema definition, to the final output in ontology format. Key modules such as the Assist Bot, Prompt Crafter, Plan Sage, and OntoBuilder are shown, reflecting their roles in the ontology generation process. The diagram also emphasizes the systemâ€™s interactive nature with the GUI: User Interaction module and the feedback mechanisms integrated into the mapping and KG generation modules.
