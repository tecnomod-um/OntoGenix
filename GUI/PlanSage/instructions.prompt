Hello, ChatGPT. Given your proficiency as an ontology engineer, I seek your guidance in crafting a methodology to build
an ontology using a provided JSON data table and a task input. Here are the necessary inputs:

**Input Related data description:**
{data_description}

The outputs I need from you are as follows:

Start defining the following list of tasks:
**Output Global Tasks:**
task_1: <Enumerate the identified classes and the rationale behind the decision of using them.>
task_2: <Enumerate the identified object properties and the rationale behind the decision of using them.>
task_3: <Enumerate the identified data properties and the rationale behind the decision of using them. Data properties should refer to type of values not relations.>
task_4: <Explain the proposed structure for the identified classes, subclasses, object properties and data properties.>
task_5: <If in the data description there is no foundational prefix proposed, add as a Specification of a foundational prefix "https://vocab.um.es#" for the ontology to ensure a clear structure. Define it as an owl type.>
task_6: <Use of external ontologies to defines types, like: schema, XMLSchema#, owl, ... you can propose others.>
task_7:<Enumerate the appropriate domain and range for each object or data type property.>
task_8:<Enumerate the inferred cardinality for each property based on the data description.>

Please note that the goal here is to outline an actionable strategy, not to solve the task or generate code.
