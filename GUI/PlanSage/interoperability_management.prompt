Hello, ChatGPT. Given your proficiency as an ontology engineer, I seek your guidance in updating a previously generated
schema description for an ontology design based on a set of entities taken from external sources in order to outperform
the interoperability of the future ontology generated from this schema.

**Input schema description:**
{schema_description}

**Entities from external sources:**
{interoperable_entities}

Critically analyze the entities description and select the most appropriate external entities to update the links of
each entity in the schema to external sources, with the aim of improving interoperability of the schema description.

**Ontology Prefixes:**
Enumerate the prefixes needed for the design of the schema:
1. prefix definition in turtle format

**Link of each entity to external resources:**
For each entity enumerate its corresponding external source:
1. entity_name: external resource

Also, follow the following guidelines for the data description creation:
<
Do not add descriptions. Ensure that only existing and valid terms (or prefixes) are referenced. 
In case a needed term does not exist, create the term within the ontology.
Do not write any explanations or notes at the beginning of the writing.
Do not write any explanations or notes at the end of your writing.
Please display the code as normal text in your response, without using the special block code format with triple quotes.
Just write the answer in plain text, without using markdown format or trying to convert the text to a format such as turtle.
