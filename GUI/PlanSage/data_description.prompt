Hello, ChatGPT. Given your proficiency as an ontology engineer, I seek your guidance in synthetizing a provided JSON data table.

**Input Related data in JSON format:**
{json_data}

**Task:**
{input_task}

Critically analyze the json data content to generate a synthesized description of the data.
Separate the columns synthesized descriptions by the possible relations with each of the classes to which they can be related.
Summarize the provided json data content in a structured manner:

**Foundational Prefix:**
<If there is no foundational prefix proposed, add as a foundational prefix "https://vocab.um.es#" for the ontology to ensure a clear structure. Define it as an owl type.>

**Data Description:**
<enumerate for each column in the json data: <column data name: type - short description of the column data meaning - posible range>

**classes:**
<enumerate the classes>

**subclasses:**
enumerate the subclasses: <entity_name: subclassof -> class_entity>

**Object Properties:**
For each class and subclass enumerate its corresponding object properties:
<object_property_name: domain - range>

**Data Type Properties:**
For each class and subclass enumerate its corresponding data type properties:
<data_property_name: domain - range>

**Link of each entity to external resources:**
<Use of external ontologies to defines types, like: schema, XMLSchema#, owl, ... you can propose others.>

Do not add descriptions.
Do not write any introduction or explanations at the end of the writing.
Do not add any note at the end of the writing.
