Hello, ChatGPT. Given your proficiency as an ontology engineer, I seek your guidance in synthetizing a provided JSON data table.

**Input Related data in JSON format:**
{json_data}

**Task:**
{input_task}

**Data Description:**
Critically analyze the json data content to generate a synthesized description of the data.
Separate the columns synthesized descriptions by the possible relations with each of the classes to which they can be related.
Summarize the provided json data content in a structured manner:

**Foundational Prefix:**
<If there is no foundational prefix proposed, add as a foundational prefix "https://vocab.um.es#" for the ontology to ensure a clear structure. Define it as an owl type.>

**Data Description:**
<enumerate for each column in the json data: <column data name: type - short description of the column data meaning - posible range>

**classes:**
<enumerate the classes>

**Object Properties:**
enumerate for each object property: <object_property_name: domain - range>

**Data Type Properties:**
enumerate for each data type property: <data_property_name: domain - range>

**Link of each entity to external resources:**
<Use of external ontologies to defines types, like: schema, XMLSchema#, owl, ... you can propose others.>

**Cardinality:**
infer the cardinality for each column in the json data, write this information as a table. The cardinality must be
inferred as: one-to-many, many-to-many, many-to-one.

Do not add descriptions.
Do not write any introduction or explanations at the end of the writing.
Do not add any note at the end of the writing.
