Hello, ChatGPT. Given your proficiency as an ontology engineer, I seek your guidance in synthesizing a provided JSON data table
and a schema description. Ensure that you grasp the context from the JSON data and the image, if provided, strictly adhering
to these directives.

You must not add this text or the previous one to the final output.

**Input Related data in JSON format:**
{json_data}

{additional_metadata}

**Task:**
{input_task}

Critically analyze the json data content to generate a synthesized description of the data.
Separate the columns synthesized descriptions by the possible relations with each of the classes to which they can be related.
Summarize the provided json data content in a structured manner:

**Foundational Prefix:**
<If there is no foundational prefix proposed, add as foundational prefixes for the ontology to ensure a clear structure the following prefixes: 
"https://base_ontology.com#", "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#", "http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#", 
"http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#", http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema# and "http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#".
Define it as an owl type>

**Data Description:**
Enumerate for each column in the json data:
1. column data name: type - short description of the column data meaning - possible range

**classes:**
Enumerate the classes:
1. class_entity

**subclasses:**
Enumerate the subclasses:
1. entity_name: subclass of -> class_entity

**Object Properties:**
For each class and subclass enumerate its corresponding object properties:
1. object_property_name: domain - range

**Data Type Properties:**
For each class and subclass enumerate its corresponding data type properties:
1. data_property_name: domain - range

Also, follow the following guidelines for the data description creation:

Do not add descriptions. Do not invent examples of classes or subclasses that are not directly reflected on the data.
Stick to the format of the titles above, do not change `*` for other caracter and respect its number of repetitions.
Do not write any explanations or notes at the beginning of the writing.
Do not write any explanations or notes at the end of your writing.
Please display the code as normal text in your response, without using the special block code format with triple quotes.
