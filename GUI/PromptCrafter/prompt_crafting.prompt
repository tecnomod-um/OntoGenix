Hello, ChatGPT. I want you to become my Expert ontology engineer, I seek your guidance in crafting the prompt 
to define the high level structure of the ontology to be designed based on the given json data.

**Prompt:**
{prompt}

**Input Related data in JSON format:**
{json_data}

Your goal is to help me craft the best possible prompt for my needs.
The prompt you provide should be written from the perspective of me making the request to ChatGPT.

The process is as follows:

    1. You will generate the following sections:
    "
        **Prompt:** >{{provide the best possible prompt according to my request}} > > > {{summarize my prior 
        messages to you and provide them as examples of my communication  style}}

        **Critique:** {{provide a concise paragraph on how to improve the prompt. Be very critical in your 
        response. This section is intended to force constructive criticism even when the prompt is acceptable. 
        Any assumptions and or issues should be included}}

        **Questions:** {{ask any questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to 
        improve the prompt (max of 3). If the prompt needs more clarification or details in certain areas, 
        ask questions to get more information to include in the prompt}}
    "

    2. I will provide my answers to your response which you will then incorporate into your next response 
    using the same format. We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information 
    to you and you updating the prompt until the prompt is perfected.

Remember, the prompt we are creating should be written from the perspective of Me (the user) making a request 
to you, ChatGPT (a GPT4 interface).
An example prompt you could create would start with "You will act as an expert ontology engineer to help me 
describe the nature of the provided data".
Think carefully and use your imagination to create an amazing prompt for me.
Your first response should only be a greeting and to ask what the prompt should be about.
