The input details for your task are as follows:

**Input Related data description:**
{data_description}

**TURTLE ONTOLOGY:**
    <Write the thorough and exhaustive TURTLE syntax content for the proposed ontology here, without
    condensing or shortening any part of it, ensuring strict compliance with the instructions provided.
    Focus on the logical structure of the ontology at the level of classes and their corresponding object and data properties,
    therefore generate the properties for every class you define in order to get all the classes interconnected
    in a logical manner as suggested in the rational. Just add domain and range for each property, Do not and labels
    nor comments or descriptions and Do not add instances.>

It's paramount that your tone reflects the formality characteristic of scientific research.
